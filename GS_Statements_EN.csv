It is with great honor that I address the 26th Conference of the Parties of 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 

The  Republic  of  Angola  considers  climate  change  one  of  the  greatest 
"challenges facing humanity, due to the set of direct and indirect effects that "
"they cause to the economic and social life of nations, a fact that constitutes "
a real challenge to development. 

We  embrace  the  cause  of  mangrove  restoration  and  protection through  a 
national  campaign  to  replant mangrove  seedlings  along  the  extensive 
national coastline. 

We  favor  the  production  and  consumption  of  clean  energy  from  existing 
"hydroelectric dams and others to be built, as well as from renewable energy "
"sources,  with  emphasis  on  photovoltaic  energy  production  projects  with "
solar  parks  that  will  reduce  the  consumption  of  fossil  fuels  in  the 
production of electricity. 

"Currently,  the  national  energy  matrix  already  incorporates  62%  of  non-"
"polluting energy sources, aiming to reach 70% by 2025. "

We  have  just  signed  in  Washington  DC  with ICCF and  Conservation 
"International, an agreement for the conservation of the Luengue-Luiana and "
"Mavinga  parks,  for  the  protection  of  animal  and  plant  wildlife  and  the "
development of sustainable international tourism. 

"We approved the National Strategy for Climate Change 2021-2035, aiming "
"to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement, as well as an important "
"environmental  legislative  package, containing  the instruments  that  will "
enable a decisive contribution to the global effort to mitigate the causes and 
adapt Angola to the effects of climate change. 

Angola  is  aligned  with  the  international  consensus  on  sustainable 
"development,  including  Africa – 2063,  in  line  with  the  Sustainable "
Development Goals. 

"Excellencies, "

Angola  defined  its Nationally  Determined  Contribution to reduce carbon 
"intensity  in  the  production  of  electricity  in  a  horizon  until  2025,  and "
"complementary actions in the field of sustainable management of forests, "
transport and agriculture. 

Adaptation actions to improve climate resilience of our communities and 
protecting social and economic investments were also included. 

We reiterate the firm commitment and determination of Angola to remain 
"engaged  in climate  action,  and  to  the  adoption  of  a  low-carbon "
development model.

"    Statement to by the Honourable Gaston Browne, Prime Minister of "
    Antigua and Barbuda and Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States 
"                              November 1, 2021 "
  
Excellencies 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
I make this statement on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. 
 
"And, I begin by thanking the Government of the United Kingdom for hosting this important "
World Leaders’ Summit - from which much is expected. 
 
"Small island developing states attend this meeting troubled, that the world is teetering "
"dangerously on the precipice of a climate catastrophe, if we overshoot the 1.5 degrees goal, "
"with fatal consequences for all, especially SIDS.   "
 
Those effects have been evident in more frequent catastrophic climate events that have 
decimated lives and livelihoods.  
 
"The difference between small island developing states and industrialized nations, is the "
capacity to respond. 
 
"It takes a single storm, a few hours to destroy the economy and infrastructure of an entire "
"small island state, which lacks the necessary financial and other resources to rebound and "
rebuild. 
 
"Colleagues, this is now the perennial experience that small island developing states suffer, "
through no fault of their own. 
 
This situation has weakened our ability to plan our economic and social development with 
predictability. 
 
"Colleagues, I remind that the contribution of all small island developing states to carbon "
"dioxide emissions and climate change, is less than one per cent of the global emissions.  "
 
Our countries are the least liable for the damage to the world’s environment; but we pay the 
highest price. 
 
"I recall the words of Aristotle: “The greatest injustices, proceed from those who pursue "
excess”. 
 
"Surely, the time has come for such excesses and injustice to end. "
 
"Colleagues, the scale of funding for climate adaptation and mitigation has been sadly "
"inadequate; it needs to be increased significantly, if justice is to be served. "
 


 
 

"AOSIS calls for direct attention to loss and damage at this COP, as a distinct issue in its own "
"right, not just on the margins of adaptation. "
 
"Such loss and damage have persisted for decades, but compensation has been neglected "
"by the governments of the worst polluting countries, for far too long. "
 
"Should no formal mechanism for loss and damage compensation be established, member "
countries of the United Nations may be prepared to seek justice in the appropriate 
international bodies. 
 
"We hoped that no one would have had to come to such a position, but our very existence "
now depends on urgent attention to our perilous situation. 
 
"Colleagues, we are all aware, that the promise made 12 years ago by the developed "
"countries, to provide $100 billion annually in climate finance, to help deal with the effects of "
"climate change, has not been fulfilled.  "
 
"However, the G20 countries have, since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, provided over "
"3 trillion US dollars in support to the fossil fuel industry, including excessive subsidies; with "
"only a meagre two billion USD per year, made available through the UN’s climate funds. "
 
"We are also aware, that the OECD has confirmed that climate finance to SIDS dropped by "
more than $600 million between 2018 and 2019. 
 
Colleagues 
 
We can all agree that this is regressive. 
 
"Worse yet, such financing, as available, is subject to conditionalities, including the "
inconsiderate and wrongful criterion of per capita income. 
 
"These conditionalities should not be applied to climate finance, and SIDS’ accessibility "
should be based on their vulnerability. 
 
Colleagues 
 
"All of this makes COP26, a truly decisive moment for small islands and countries with low-"
lying coastal states.   
 
"This is the last decade the world has, to avoid the worst impacts of global warming; and "
"COP 26 is our last chance to deliver on ambitious commitments and actions, to avert "
catastrophic consequences. 
 
I plead that we do not squander this crucial opportunity. 
 
COP26 should deliver the following commitments: reduced emissions to keep temperatures 
"below 1.5 degrees; phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies, scaled up and accessible adaptation "
and mitigation funding and a firm mechanism for loss and damage; as we work in global 
solidarity to save our planet and human civilization.   
 
There is work to be done. We are on the clock. Our children are watching.

                     COP26 Speech 
"Your royal highnesses, your excellencies, ladies and gentlemen.  "
"For millennia,  technological  and  economic  development  moved  at  a "
"steady pace. That is until the advent of the Industrial Revolution, which "
"set  in  motion  profound  changes  for  mankind,  ushering  in  an  era  of "
change made on a previously unimaginable scale.    
"In  the  nineteenth  century,  the  vast  majority  of  humanity  experienced "
"extreme poverty; today, that figure stands at less than 10 percent. Two "
"hundred years ago, half of children born died before the age of five; now, "
"less than four percent suffer this fate. Since then, our progress led to the "
"rise  of  a  global  order  characterized  by  economic  interdependence, "
"which, in turn, brought stability to many regions of the world. "
"Sadly, these feats, however impressive, came at a price for our planet "
and our collective duty is to ensure that it does not cost us the earth. In 
"doing so, we must harness our productive potential with the same drive "
that greeted the dawn of the Industrial Age – marshalling the might of 
innovation  and  human  ingenuity  to  propel  a  greener and more 
prosperous world.  
PAUSE  
Emissions reductions through investment in renewable energy is certainly 
"a central feature of this approach. But, even as we increase renewable "
"energy’s share of global demand, carbon will remain a fixture of the global "
energy mix for many years to come. Billions of tons of carbon will need 
to be removed and sequestered each year if we are to arrive at net zero 
and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  

PAUSE  
1
 
 

 
While  the  Kingdom  of  Bahrain  is  responsible  for  just  0.07  percent  of 
"global emissions, we recognize, not least as an island nation, that climate "
change is a global challenge that requires global solutions. Developing 
the kinds of technologies necessary to meaningfully address the climate 
"crisis requires us to both act in concert, but also to lead by example.   "
"Today, I am pleased to announce that Bahrain is committed to reaching "
net zero by 2060 and has set a range of ambitious interim goals to ensure 
"that we proceed without delay. By 2035, we will reduce emissions by 30 "
percent through decarbonization and efficiency initiatives and double our 
deployment of renewables from the targets we set at COP21. Our 2035 
targets also include carbon removal solutions by quadrupling mangrove 
"coverage,  doubling  tree  coverage  in  Bahrain,  and  directly  investing  in "
"carbon capture technologies, which we believe is essential. "
Forums  like  COP26  and  the  recently  concluded  Middle  East  Green 
Initiative serve as vital reminders of our  shared interests and common 
future.  We must take advantage of these opportunities to deliver on the 
"promises we make and have made, identifying multilateral solutions that, "
"vitally, are accessible to all. "
PAUSE  
A future net-zero economy capable of propelling humanity to new heights 
"depends entirely on the ability of all people to participate in it, both as "
producers and as consumers. We must therefore ensure that our work 
to curb emissions moves in lockstep with our work to improve livelihoods. 
We owe it to posterity to leverage the achievements of the Industrial Age 
"in order to deliver a cleaner, more prosperous future.  "
Thank you.

WLS - Opening Ceremony 
Remarks by Mia Amor Mottley 
Prime Minister of Barbados 
 
1-Nov-21
 
 
The pandemic has taught us that national solutions to global problems do not work. 
  
We come to  Glasgow with global ambition to save our people and our planet but now find three 
gaps: 
 
On mitigation Climate pledges or NDCs  
Without more we will leave  the world on 2.7 degree pathway.  
 
Those commitments based on technologies yet to be developed are at best reckless and at 
worst  dangerous.  
 
On finance we are 20 billion dollars short of the 100 and  this commitment MIGHT only be met 
in 2023.  
 
On adaptation- Adaptation finance remains  only 25 % – NOT the 50:50 split needed given the 
warming that is already taking place. Climate finance to frontline SiDs declined by 25% in 2019. 
Failure to provide this critical finance and that of  loss and damage is measured in lives and 
livelihoods being lost  in our communities. It is immoral and unjust. 
 
"If Glasgow is to deliver on the promises of Paris, it must close these three gaps.  "
 
"So I ask  - what must we say to our people living on the frontline in the Caribbean , Africa and "
the Pacific when both ambition and some of the needed faces are absent?  
 
What excuse should we give for their failure? IN THE WORDS OF EDDY GRANT ‘WILL THEY 
MOURN US ON THE FRONTLINE?’ 
 
When will we as world leaders address the pressing issues that are cause our people to worry – 
be it climate or vaccines? When will leaders lead? 
 
Our people are watching and taking note.  
  
Are we really going to leave Scotland without the resolve and ambition that is sorely needed to 
save lives and to save our planet? 
 
"I have been saying to Barbadians, many hands make light work. Today we need  "
 the correct mix of voices and ambition. 
 
Do some leaders believe they can survive and thrive on their own?  
Can there be peace and prosperity in one third of the world if two thirds are UNDER siege and 
facing calamitous threats to their wellbeing? 
 
What the world needs now is less than 200 persons who are willing and prepared to lead!! 
Leaders must not fail those who elect them to lead.  
 
There is a sword that can cut down this Gordian knot; it has been wielded before. 
  
The Central Banks of the wealthiest countries engaged in 25 trillion dollars of quantitative 
easing in 13 years; $9 trillion in 18 months. Had we used the $25trn to purchase bonds that 
"financed the energy transition, we would BE keeping within 1.5 degrees. "
  
An annual increase in SDRs of $500bn for 20 years put in a Trust to finance the transition is the 
"REAL gap we need to close, not the $50bn being proposed FOR adaptation.  "
 
"If 500bn sounds big to you, it is just 2% of that $25trn. This is the sword we need to wield. "
 
OUR excitement one hour into this event is far less than six months ago in the lead up.  
 
The world stands at a fork in the road; one no less significant than when the United Nations was 
first created in 1945.  
 
Will  we act in the interest of our people who are depending on us or will we allow the path of 
greed and selfishness to sow the seeds of our common destruction? 
 
"Leaders today, not leaders in 2030 or 2050, must make this choice.  "
 
It is in our hands. Our people and our planet need it. 
       UNITED NATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE 
"           GLASGOW, SCOTLAND, UNITED KINGDOM "
            ADDRESS BY THE HON. JOHN BRICENO 
 
"Your Excellencies, greetings from Belize.   "
"President Alok Sharma, congratulations on your election as President. "
 
I extend my delegation’s deep appreciation to the Government and people 
of the United Kingdom for their gracious hospitality. 
 
I’m here as a Belizean and as a global citizen to call for solidarity.  
"As a member of AOSIS, Belize is here to demand urgent action to combat "
climate change. 
 
Climate  change  is  the  greatest  challenge  to  humanity  -  devastating  in  its 
impacts on every aspect of our lives especially on those most vulnerable.  
 
"It is increasing poverty, eroding land and other resources of low-lying islands "
and coastal states and threatening food security and livelihoods for hundreds 
"of millions, and for generations yet to come.  "
 
"Belize is the proud custodian of the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System, the "
second largest reef system in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  
 
But here is the sad reality.    
The reef is under siege.   
Coral bleaching stress doubled from 1.7 in the period 1985-2014 to severe 
level 3 between 2014-2017. 

1
The reef is dying and may be beyond the point of full restoration.  
Its loss will be irreversible.   
 
"For Belize, the Barrier Reef is more than a global beauty; it also underpins "
our  culture  and  our  tourism  industry  which  contributes  approximately  40 
percent to our gross domestic product.  
"Without the reefs, Belize’s economy could crumble.  "
Our people’s lives will be forever changed. 
 
"Excellencies,  the  threat  to  our  Barrier  Reef  is  a  direct  result  of  human "
induced climate change.  
That is an undeniable fact.   
Belize is doing what it can to slow the impacts.  
But we are struggling to respond as those impacts continue to accelerate.   
 
"In 2019, Belize suffered a severe drought wreaking havoc on our agricultural "
crops.   
 
"In late 2020, more than 15 percent of our population were directly affected "
by the unprecedented floods caused by tropical storms ETA and IOTA – with 
loss and damage estimated at roughly 3 percent of GDP.  
 
Belize’s  annual  average  losses  from  extreme  weather  events  are  now 
approaching four percent of GDP.  
 
Forced to accumulate an unsustainable debt load for disaster recoveries has 
become an unbearable cost. 

2
 
"We all know however that acting together, we can, and we must. "
We have a collective duty to do what’s right. 
COP-26 is a tipping point for climate action. 
Belize is doing more than its fair share.   
 
 
Belize is a net carbon sink.   
Over 60 percent of our land has forest cover.  
"More than 40 percent of which is protected for conservation and biodiversity, "
while roughly 15 percent of our marine area is under protection.   
"Both on land and in the sea, we have exceeded conservation targets. "
 
We have not stopped there.   
"This year, with the Nature Conservancy and Re:Wild, almost 5 percent more "
of our lands have been placed in conservation in perpetuity.   
 
I am also very pleased to announce that Belize just entered a 360-million-
dollar debt-for-marine conservation transaction.  
The largest blue bond transaction ever.  
This  historic  transaction  will  reduce  our  unsustainable  debt  load  of  127 
percent of GDP by 15 percent.  
And establish a permanent $100 million US marine conservation trust fund.   
 
We will increase our marine protected biodiversity zones to 30 percent by 
"2026, four years ahead of target.   "


3
And  we  will  place  all  remaining  public  lands  in  the  Belize  Barrier  Reef 
Reserve System under protection.   
 
"Mister President, Belize is proud of our record on conservation.   "
"But all will be lost, if the countries of the G20 obfuscate, and abdicate their "
responsibilities to act.  
"With right on our side, we demand climate justice.   "
We demand immediate action!  
Ambitious action to save our planet. 
 
"To date, NDC’s of the major emitters are not in line with the objective of the "
Paris Agreement.  
This places the world at risk of global warming close to three degrees.     
 
These same countries account for ¾ of global emissions and 80 percent of 
"global  GDP,  they  channel  trillions  of  dollars  towards  fossil  fuels,  while "
developed  countries  shirk  their  commitment  to  deliver  a  bare  minimum of 
100 billion US dollars per annum.   
 
This is rank negligence.  
We need to get serious.   
 
"To  address  the  vulnerabilities  we  are  experiencing,  affordable,  sufficient, "
"predictable, and timely climate finance is urgently needed.  "
 
Developed countries must not only deliver but increase their commitments 
on climate finance.  

4
One hundred billion US dollars per year can only now serve as the baseline. 
 
Talk of reducing and averting loss and damage must give way to dedicated 
"financial, technical, and capacity building support to address actual loss and "
damage in developing countries.  
 
Funding for adaptation must be dramatically increased.  
"At a minimum, developed countries need to more than double public finance "
for adaptation.   
We  need  to  move  from  carbon  trading  toward  carbon  emission  reduction 
mechanisms with rules that apply to everyone.  
 
 
"For  this  to  work,  credits  should  only  be  generated  from  activities  within "
Nationally Determined Contributions.  
"There  should  be  no  double  counting  of  emission  reduction  credits,  and  a "
"material share of proceeds should go to the Adaptation Fund, while a portion "
of  credits  canceled  as  a  fundamental  contribution  to  global  emissions 
reductions. 
 
"Now, let’s be clear.  "
Net zero by 2050 will not get the G20 off the hook from halving emissions by 
"2030, the former means nothing without the latter.  "
New 1.5 aligned NDCs must be delivered before any stock-take if we are 
going to make meaningful progress on Paris.  Or more bluntly if we are going 
to save lives. 
 

5
 
"Mister President, the people of Belize and the developing world have heard "
"enough talk, been disappointed by empty promises and are skeptical of pious "
pledges.  
"Every  dollar  my  country  invests  in  climate  action,  G20  countries  undo "
"multiple times over with the trillions they invest in oil, coal and gas.  "
Every step forward we make on development is easily reversed by the failure 
of G20 countries to act in line with the Paris promise of 1.5. 
Belize is taking ambitious action. But there are some amongst us with a much 
bigger duty to act. 
 
"Mother Earth can wait no more, she can suffer no more, she is dying.  "
"Mister President, the world is watching.  "
People are awaiting the outcomes of COP-26.  
 
"This  is  the COP to  stand with  the  vulnerable, to  show  you  are  for us  not "
against us.  
" We all know what we need to do, we must summon the courage and moral "
strength to act.  
None of us can afford to fail.     
Thank you.

"                    Hon’ble Minister,"
"               Ministry of Agriculture and Forest,"
                Royal Government of Bhutan
"at the High Level Segment of COP26/CMP16/CMA3 to UNFCCC, Glasgow, the"
                        UK
"                    November 9, 2019"

"Mr. President,"
"Excellencies,"
"Distinguished Delegates,"
"Ladies and Gentlemen,"

"At the outset, let me congratulate you on your election as the President"
"of COP26. On behalf of the Bhutanese delegation, I also would like to"
thank the United Kingdom and people of Scotland for the warm
hospitality and excellent arrangements made for the conference. With
"great pleasure, I have the privilege to acknowledge the kindness,"
"friendliness nature of the security force, volunteers and every individual"
"citizen of Glasgow city. Everywhere we went, people were so friendly"
and helpful.

"From COP26, Bhutan as the Chair of the LDCs Group and as a highly"
"vulnerable country, I would like to appeal to the COP26 Presidency and"
"the negotiating partners to consider; scaling up finance for Adaptation,"
"Loss and damages, technology transfer and capacity building to enable"
us recover from the impacts of severe impacts of climate induced
disasters. LDCs do not contribute to GHG emissions but bear the brunt
"of the climate change impacts. Water resources, agriculture and"
"infrastructure for life, food security and livelihood are at risk in the"
fragile mountain ecosystems of countries like Bhutan. We are imposed
"on, with loss and damages frequently induced by climate disasters. As"
"such, Adaptation is a priority for us. Adaptation therefore must be"
supported with grants in finance. We would like our partners to live upto
the US$100 billion climate finance commitment and Adaptation must
receive equal share in climate financing.

Mr. President!

Bhutan under the policy guidance of our Environmental Champion
Monarchs have demonstrated enough leadership in environmental
conservation and our low emission development policy for climate
change and sustainable development goals are committed. Just to set the
"tone with an example, we are committed to go e-mobility in our"
transport sector and energy efficient housing to transform from fossil
fuels run transport and domestic cooking and heating. Initiating electric
"train transport, increasing electric vehicles in public and private"
transport across the country is an immediate target in our country. We
"would like to invite investors; governments, multinational donors,"
"INGOs, and the private sector to support such green initiatives in our"
country.

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit everyone around the globe. But poorer
nations already impacted by the climate crisis are the worst hit. We
would like to request leaders to consider post pandemic economic
support rather than attempting to recover to pre-pandemic status.


Mr. President!

Let me echo other Hindu Kush Himalayas initiatives and three messages
of the region. The water tower of the world is the worst hit and with the
slightest temperature rise can have detrimental effects on its glaciers and
"downstream, as confirmed by the latest IPCC report. We need regional"
cooperation and global support in saving the Himalayas and the
livelihoods of 240 million people living within these mountain
ecosystems.

Mr. President!

While Bhutan acknowledges and welcomes the COP26 Presidency’s
"“climate finance delivery plan: meeting the US$ 100 billion goal”, and"
"the contributions committed by partners in LDCF replenishment, we"
"would like to reiterate that climate finance must be predictable, easily"
accessible and sustainable based on the priorities and needs of the
vulnerable countries. Countries that are committed and have provided
leadership prominence must be recognized with funding assurances.

"As we approach the final week of the COP26, lots need to be done to"
conclude remaining work for implementing the Paris Agreement. We
"must speed up to deliver ambitious, concrete and enhanced climate"
"action and support. For Bhutan, let me once again reiterate that COP26"
"must deliver concrete decisions on enhanced ambition, adaptation, loss"
"and damage, robust rule for implementation of market and non-market"
mechanism that ensures environmental integrity and enhanced financial
support for climate action.

Mr. President!

Bhutan remains committed to the principles and objectives of the
"Convention and Paris Agreement and calls on all Parties to be flexible,"
open and constructive to deliver a strong climate action and support. Our
actions today will go a long way towards securing a green and
sustainable future for generations to come.

Thank you and Tashi Delek!

"It is an honor to be here, representing Brazil, at this important Conference of the "
"Parties in Glasgow. I thank, on behalf of our delegation, for the kind reception and I "
"congratulate the COP26 team for the organization. In our case, this effort was mutual, "
because Brazil also received Glasgow. We set up an interactive structure and 
"promoted the participation of 10 ministers of state, connected in real time to our "
"pavilion here in Glasgow, demonstrating the integrated action of the Brazilian "
"government in the international climate agenda. Thus, it was also possible to present "
cases of a real Brazil in several panels. 
 
"This is part of a greater effort, with already clear outcomes. Brazil, as a key player in "
"the negotiations, made important moves during the first days and we announced even "
more ambitious climate targets: 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and climate 
neutrality by 2050; eliminate illegal deforestation by 2028; and support the global 
methane reduction. We proactively gave clear signs that Brazil is part of the solution to 
overcome this global challenge to reduce emissions. 
 
"Brazil is gigantic by nature, so our actions reflect the proportions of our territory and "
our people. Our low-carbon agriculture has already restored nearly 28 million hectares 
of degraded pastures and will increase this number to 58 million by 2030; we have the 
"world's largest biofuels operational program, our renewable energies contribute to "
"84% of our electricity matrix, generating a record of 380 thousand jobs in solar and "
wind; we have 16 million hectares of native forests in recovery; and our solid waste 
management program has already reduced the number of dumpsites by 20%. 
 
"We particularly highlight the Águas Brasileiras Program, which aims to plant 100 "
"million trees in the Cerrado, Pantanal and Caatinga biomes. Also, the New Basic "
"Sanitation Framework, which gives the opportunity for the private sector to provide "
"wastewater treatment to over 100 million people. Also, the incredible transformation "
"from the logistical modal to railroads, with more than 5,000 km of new rails, "
representing a 75% reduction in emissions of GEE in cargo transport and equating the 
Brazilian modal to that of developed countries. Results like these demonstrate the 
strength of the current and real Brazilian environmental policy. 
 
"But the Government of Brazil wants more. Less than a month ago, we launched the "
"foundations of the National Green Growth Program, to give priority to green "
"initiatives, whether public or private, aimed at reducing emissions, forest conservation "
"and rational use of natural resources, hence contributing to the generation of green "
jobs. The program already includes resources from federal banks in the order of 50 
billion dollars. 
 
We recognize our challenges and have been working to overcome them. To contain 
"illegal deforestation in the Amazon, the Federal Government doubled the resources "
allocated to federal environmental agencies and is going to hire 739 new 
"environmental agents. In addition, the Ministry of Justice collaborates with 700 men in "
"the field, working in 23 municipalities in an ostensible and permanent way. The "
"Ministry of Defense, through Censipam, recently launched an innovative and even "
more accurate forest monitoring system. 
 
"We also recognize that where there is a lot of forest there is also a lot of poverty. And, "
"to promote sustainable development in the region, we created the National Program "
"for Payments for Environmental Services Floresta+, which seeks to promote the "
"market for environmental services, recognizing and providing payments to those who "
take care of the forest. 
 
"At this COP and even long before we get here, our Delegation has been working to "
"achieve positive results in creating a global carbon market under Article 6, "
understanding Brazil's role in building bridges between the different parties and its 
"potential as an exporter of carbon credits, contributing to a more balanced global "
reduction. 
 
It is important that developed countries recognize the financial emergency and 
mobilize the necessary resources to achieve the desired goals at this conference. The 
$100 billion target was not met and currently this figure is no longer sufficient for the 
world to build a new green economy with a responsible transition. More ambitious 
"volumes are needed, with easy access and agile execution, so that the transformation "
"takes place in an inclusive way in each territory around the world, mainly in regions "
that are more vulnerable in terms of climate and economic development. 
 
The countries that are historically and currently responsible for the largest volumes of 
"emissions must demonstrate their effective funding ambitions at this conference, "
"without further postponing a commitment made in 2015 and so far, not fully realized. "
 
All parties of this conference must take on their common but differentiated 
responsibilities towards a green economy neutral in emissions. The global challenge to 
"be overcome is to revert the negative logic of punishment, sanction and prohibition to "
"the positive logic of incentive, innovation and prioritization. It is necessary to "
transform the environmental agenda into an opportunity to generate green jobs. 
"Based on a constructive vision, we will find the way to create the sustainable future we "
all want. 
 
The Green Future has already started in Brazil. 
 
Thank you very much.

"Mr. President, "
 
The current global pandemic has much to teach us about an even more existential threat 
– the climate crisis. 
 
"Brunei Darussalam is a small country. 72 percent of our area is still forested, currently "
absorbing 97 percent of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
"Two years ago, we celebrated a milestone - 90 years of our oil and gas industry. But "
"really, for us, it was a celebration of 90 years as a carbon-negative oil and gas producing "
and exporting country. We have held this title long enough to continue to call nature as 
"our number one ally. Not just for climate mitigation, but equally important, for climate "
adaptation. 
 
"As a small country located along the coast, our exposure to climate change is very high. "
We hear the science. We understand the devastating impacts. We know that majority of 
"our key strategic areas across the country, could be under water as early as 2050. This "
"has urged us to look beyond our current efforts, in keeping the 1.5 degrees target alive. "
 
"Last year we launched our National Climate Change Policy, outlining ten key strategies "
that  would  shape  our  low  carbon  and  climate-resilient  future.  We  have  also 
"communicated our NDC at the end of last year, with a commitment to reduce 20 percent "
of our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  
 
"In further enhancing our climate ambition, Brunei Darussalam is moving towards net zero "
"by 2050, that will be driven mainly through energy transition and forests preservation.  It "
"will not be an easy task ahead for us, but it is necessary. "
 
 


2
                                                                         FINAL 
"We have done this for almost a decade, and we will continue to maintain it, and this time "
"around, we would be unlocking huge opportunities for green growth and green jobs.  Our "
"country only contributes to about 0.025 percent of the global greenhouse emissions, but "
"we believe with our small actions, will make a huge positive difference.  "
 
"Progress, however, require action from many others.  "
 
"As ASEAN Chair this year, Brunei Darussalam is honoured to present the ASEAN Joint "
Statement  to  COP  26. ASEAN has  reaffirmed  the  region’s collective  commitment  on 
"climate action, both to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. "
 
ASEAN calls upon developed country parties to strengthen support and cooperation to 
"accelerate  climate  action  in  the  region. Under  the  theme “We  Care,  We  Prepare,  We "
"Prosper”, ASEAN this year saw, among others:- "
 
Firstly: Communication of enhanced NDCs;  
 
Secondly: Support in principle the establishment of an ASEAN Center for Climate Change 
in Brunei Darussalam;  
 
Thirdly: The creation of the ASEAN Youth on Climate Action platform programme; 
 
Fourthly: The development of the ASEAN Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance. 
 
"This includes the launching of the ASEAN Green Initiative, renewed regional renewable "
"energy, and energy efficiency and conservation targets in accelerating climate action.  "
 
"Lastly, I wish to thank the UK for the hospitality and arrangements for this COP26. Let’s "
"act now, and let’s act now, together. Thank you. "

                       NATIONAL STATEMENT 
"                  By Head of the Cambodian Delegation,  "
"               H.E. Mr. SAY Samal, Minister of Environment "
  At the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 26/ CMP 16/CMA 3 
"                      Glasgow, UK, November 2021  "
                                    
"-  Mr. President, "
"-  Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen! "
 
1. I’m delighted to join you all here in this Conference in Glasgow. The Cambodian 
   delegation appreciates and thanks the United Kingdom and all those involved for 
   making this crucial meeting possible. 
2. This  is  our  unprecedented  gathering.  Unprecedented  because  of  COVID-19. 
   Unprecedented also because climate change is no longer a hearsay. 
"3. Climate  change,  like  pandemics, has  no border,  and  our  presence  here  signifies "
"   shared concerns and reassurance that, as world leaders, we are not losing sight of "
   our shared responsibility for climate action.  
4. Cambodia feels the crises directly and takes them seriously. To prevent the spread 
"   and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, we have comprehensive vaccination, strict "
"   health and social measures being put in place. Still, new variants remain a threat, "
   making our socio-economic recovery  challenging. Such  crises  require stronger 
"   international solidarity and cooperation, both bilateral and multilateral, including "
   financial supports and investments from developed to developing countries to enable 
   a new path  toward  resilient growth as  well  as public well-being  and health 
   protection. 
"5. Cambodia, a low emission country, is strongly committed to doing our share in the "
   global  efforts.  Full  peace  and political stability  have  permitted steady  economic 
"   growth  averaged over  7%  per  annum,  thus allowing us  to make increasing "
   contributions.  
"6. We have tripled our climate budgets in the last five years, now around 2% of the "
   GDP.  


1
 
 
 
"7. We  have  commissioned over 400 MW of utility-scale  solar energy, representing "
   15% of our energy mix. 
8. We submitted NDC update targeting around 42% in emissions reduction by 2030. 
   Our national total biomass is bigger than ever before. 
"9. We are increasing share of clean energy, not developing any new coal power plants "
   and not constructing any new hydropower dam along the Mekong River.  
10. We are also formulating a Long-Term Strategy for Carbon Neutrality to promote 
"   activities that can deliver low carbon, climate resilient, and inclusive growth. This "
   also  will  help  us  seize  the  opportunities  of  green  economy – a  major  driver  of 
"   growth, investment, and innovation in the coming decades. "
"-  Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen! "
    
11. I acknowledge the progress made since the Paris Agreement. Updated NDCs have 
   shown increased climate ambition. Large economies have set net zero emissions 
   targets. Private and public investments in green technologies have risen. 
"12. Still, we remain concerned that the level of commitments falls far short of the 1.5°C "
"   target, which puts us on a dangerous path, particularly for the post-COVID recovery "
   in LDCs. 
"13. International  climate  finance is  also far  from the  required  scale,  particularly  for "
"   adaptation, and difficult to access for the most climate vulnerable countries. We call "
   for  developed  countries  to  increase  their  contributions  to  financial  mechanisms 
"   under the Convention, and to further facilitate direct access to the funds. Otherwise, "
"   promoting  sustainable and  climate  resilient infrastructures,  disaster  management "
"   capabilities, and low-carbon development in LDCs would barely be an empty talk. "
"14. We expect this COP to address these issues, so pledges become actions. We also "
"   hope the Paris Agreement implementation guidelines, including a strong set of rules "
"   for  carbon  markets  under  Article  6,  will  be  finalized  here, to encourage forest "
   protection and promote  sustainable financing  for adaptation  and  mitigation 
   activities. 
"15.  Now that we enter the crucial decade of action envisioned by the Paris Agreement, "
"   it is not a time for hesitation or half-measures, but for ambition, decisiveness, and "
   implementation. 
"16. I hope COP26 will mark a new era for climate action, at the scale and speed needed "
   for the well-being of our people. 
"17. Finally, I wish COP26 a fruitful success. "
                                                           Thank you!

           General Debate UNFCCC World Leader’s Summit 
"        Mr. Carlos Alvarado Quesada, President of the Republic "
 
"Excelencias, honorables invitados, delegados, "
 
 
Deseo  agradecer  al  gobierno  de  Chile  por  haber  ejercido  la  Presidencia  en  estos  momentos  tan 
"complejos, e igualmente agradecer al Reino Unido todos los esfuerzos realizados para hacer posible "
"esta COP26 presencial, muchas gracias por acogernos en Glasgow.  "

"Today I will not come here with a lengthy speech, there is no time for it!  "

"Not only that We are not on track to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, but on the contrary that "
We are on track for a climate catastrophe.  

The 2021 Emissions Gap Report shows that with the current NDCs the global temperature right 
"now will rise to over 2,5 degrees Celsius.   "

I would like to recall the need to cut our global emissions by 45% in 2030 with respect to 
"2010, to keep the 1.5 goal alive. "

"And let´s be frank my fellows, keeping the 1.5 goal alive is a matter of survival, is a matter of "
"climate justice, of equity.   "

"Yes, 2020 and 2021 have been a clear example of the pain, economic shocks and devastation that "
the  increase  of  every  fraction  of  global  temperature  can  generate.  We  have  seen  different 
"regions on the Earth affected by floods, wildfires, hurricanes, droughts, sea level rise, migrations, "
"the more we approach the tipping points, the more suffering we generate. "

"But today, at the same time that we are facing the COVID pandemic, the climate change and the "
"biodiversity crisis, the world is investing more in weapons! For me, this is immoral!  "

Is this the kind of legacy  that We as leaders want to deliver?  

"Not me,  "

"This is why my country, a tiny territory of 5 million people, like a small hummingbird, in the middle "
"of Central America, is taking decarbonization and nature conservation as building blocks for its "
development model. We have made investments to ensure that our electricity remains produced 
99% from renewable sources for seven years in a row now.. We have been investing in charging 
stations for EVs so you can travel from the Pacific to the Caribbean in electric vehicles. We are 
generating the enabling conditions in terms of policies and regulations to consolidate the green 
"hidrogen ecosystem in the country. And we want to continue giving clear signals to the markets, "
"and to the kind of foreign  direct investments that we want to attract, and for this reason we  are "
"promoting a bill to ban gas and oil exploration and exploitation in the territory, and at the same "
time  we are working to protect 30% of our oceans in this year.  We know that this is the economy 
"of the future, that generates jobs and welfare for our societies.  "

"But we are like a small hummingbird flying in the middle of a storm. We are trying to do our part, "
"but we need the big emitters to contribute with their share, to take bold actions, enhance their "
NDCs  and transform their commitments into real action.       

"It is clear that this transformation requires the mobilization of trillions of dollars, from public and "
"private sources. It is critical that the whole financial flows align to the Paris Goals, we cannot continue "
investing and subsidising activities that harm nature and carbonize our societies.   

"But let me be clear, this is a time for extreme solidarity. We need a balanced approach for mitigation "
"and adaptation finance, We need more grant-based finance, and We need to improve the quality and "
accessibility of these resources.  

"When  we  abolished  the  army  in  1948  that  was  a  leap  of  faith,  now  we  need  to  abolish  our "
dependency on fossil fuels.  

"WE can be the change, as part of this generation of leaders and decision-makers. "

WE can be the ones responsible to lead the way of the transformational change that needs to 
happen in this decisive decade. 

"WE need to inspire everyone at all levels to push beyond ‘business as usual,’ demonstrating that "
"we have the knowledge, the technology, the resources, the will and the solidarity to achieve this "
common goal. 

WE must be brave - and intolerant to those that resist change.  

 
Thank you very much

"Your excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen …….  "
Dominicans are proud stewards of our pristine natural 
environment.  
We have protected Mother Earth and believe  
as our invincible Kalinago ancestors did  
that everything in nature is connected  
"and our fate as humans is tied to the trees, the water  "
and the air that we breathe. 
I am a proud descendant of the Kalinago who fought 
to  protect  our  islands  from  the  onslaught  of 
colonization 
We came close to extinction but courage and resilience 
sustained us 
We have a once in an intergenerational opportunity to 
take  some  brave  decisions and  tackle  the  climate 
crisis head on.  
Dominica has made its commitment absolutely clear.

Following near total destruction by Hurricane Maria in 
"2017,  "
our  Prime  Minister expressed  the aspirations  of  his 
people  to  become  the  world’s  first  climate-resilient 
nation  
"Though  we  have  limited  resources,  we  are  throwing "
everything we have at achieving this.  
"But, We are running out of time to reverse destructive "
environmental  practices   that  are  already  having 
severe consequences for small island developing states  
"That matters most,   "
"not only for you here today,  "
"but for young people growing up in our small islands,  "
and for future generations. 
Developed  countries  need  to  assist SIDS to  become 
resilient and sustainable.  
There is a moral obligation to do so.  
Climate Justice demands it.  
Our young people now face an unprecedented threat.  
They will inherit what has been referred to as “a triple 
jeopardy of: 
"         o crippling debt,  "
"         o a degraded environment, and  "
         o frequent and destructive disasters”.   
 
SIDS have high levels of debt distress primarily linked 
"to responding to climate impacts,  "
and  currently  there  is  no  viable  long-term debt 
reduction strategy;  

2
 
 

"yet still, SIDS are receiving less than 2% of all climate "
finance  
Almost  all  the Aichi Biodiversity  targets  for  the  last 
decade were missed 
Hurricanes  are  becoming  more   frequent  and  more 
intense. 
Dominica  and  other  small  islands are  seeking new 
opportunities.  
These  lie  in  decarbonisation  and  renewable  energy 
"technologies,  "
"in more sustainable forms of tourism,  "
and digitalisation of the economy.  
"The younger generation is already onboard,  "
they are seeking out opportunities to innovate.  
"They are bold, less jaded by the past,  "
but they are also driven by a desire to live on a healthy 
"planet,  "
to preserve  the territorial  and  cultural  integrity of 
their island homes in their lifetimes.  
"Dominica has a clear plan in place to become resilient,  "
but we cannot do this alone.  
"The clock is ticking, and the challenge is immense,  "
and  we  therefore  call  on  our  developed  partner 
countries.  
Provide the support that SIDS need for our mitigation 
and adaptation efforts;  
Help us achieve 1.5 to Stay Alive.

   STATEMENT BY HIS MAJESTY AND INGWENYAMA OF THE 
 KINGDOM OF ESWATINI: 26TH CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES 
                     TO THE UNFCCC. 

"Mr. President, "

"Heads of States and Governments, "

"Secretary General of the United Nations, "

"The Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, "
"Excellences and Colleagues, "

Distinguished Delegates. 
          
It is with great honour for me to present this Statement on behalf of His Majesty 
King Mswati III and the Eswatini nation at this august gathering. 
          
          
"Mr. President, "
          
Allow  me  to  congratulate  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  for  the 
excellent  task  of  ensuring  that  we  gather  in  this  physical  session  here  in  this 
"beautiful  City  of  Glasgow,  despite  the COVID-19 pandemic limitations and "
related uncertainties. Eswatini believes that you and the Secretariat braved such 
odds to present the sense of urgency on the need to accelerate mitigation ambition 
"during this critical decade, in order to keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius in reach in line "
with the Paris Agreement temperature goal. We pledge our support to you and my 

1
delegation is committed to involvement in all deliberations to ensure a successful 
"outcome of this Conference, including the completion of the rules governing the "
implementation of Paris Agreement. 
          
          
"Mr. President, "
          
The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Report shows that 1.5 
"degrees Celsius of global warming is likely to occur, and Eswatini together with "
all of Southern Africa warms at twice the global rate. We therefore can expect 
that the SADC region will experience nor less than a 3 degrees’ Celsius warming. 
This is happening amidst the extreme weather events already experienced such as 
"heatwaves, floods and droughts. The warnings are clear that these events will "
dramatically increase in intensity and frequency over the coming years. 

"The livelihoods of emaSwati depend heavily on agriculture, which suffered the "
drastic effects of Cyclone Eloise. Such extreme weather patterns have resulted in 
a dramatic decline in agricultural production. 
          
          
"Despite the restrictions caused by the COVID 19 Pandemic, Eswatini is taking "
"bold action to address climate change, with significant national resources being "
allocated  to  adaptation  and  mitigation  actions  in  a  balanced  approach.  We 
understand  the  urgency  of  climate  action  and  have  adopted  policies  and 
"programmes such as the National Climate Change Policy, National Development "
Strategy  and  the COVID-19  Economic  Recovery  Strategy  which  incorporate 
robust climate action. 

We have pledged to considerably raise investment in and access to  renewable 
energy to the population by increasing the share of renewable energy to 50% in 
"the electricity mix by 2030 relative to 2010 levels through the adoption of solar, "
"wind, biomass, hydro, and solar water heater technologies. "
          

2
          
"Mr President, "
          
"Developing countries, especially Africa including small states like Eswatini are "
"ready to transform their economies, however, without the much needed adequate, "
"predictable, and accessible financial support this remains an impossible task for "
us. 

We therefore emphasize the importance of the delivery of support for developing 
"countries,  including  through  the  fulfilment  of  the  developed  country  goal  of "
"jointly mobilizing US$100 billion per year by 2020 and annually through to 2025, "
in  the  context  of  meaningful  mitigation  actions  and  transparency  on 
"implementation, and delivering a significant increase in finance for adaptation. "
          
          
"Mr. President, "
Eswatini continues to fully support the effective implementation of  the  Paris 
"Agreement  and  has  submitted her enhanced  and  ambitious,  updated National "
Determined Contributions (NDCs) which focus on all sectors. This is despite the 
fact that as a nation we contribute as little as 0.007% share to the Global GHG 
emissions. 

We  call  upon  all  Parties  to  be  as  transparent  and  communicate  their new or 
"updated NDCs of highest possible ambition, and long- term strategies that set out "
a pathway towards net zero in order to  keep  the  targeted  1.5 degree  Celsius 
objective of the Paris Agreement. 
          
          
"Mr President, "
          
As this COP calls for the world to collectively respond to the climate  change 
"challenge, Eswatini notes that, for purely political reasons, Taiwan’s participation "
in the UNFCCC is restricted to the very limited quota of an NGO and it is still 
being  denied  the  opportunity  to  submit  its  ambitious  NDCs  to  the  UNFCCC 

3
Secretariat. This contradicts the spirit of the second UN principle of living no one 
behind. 
          
          
Responding to climate change requires solidarity and courage. For the UNFCCC 
"to be effective, we plead that Taiwan be afforded the opportunity to  participate  in "
"global mechanisms, negotiations, and activities that promote the implementation "
of the Paris Agreement. Taiwan exhorts all parties to look beyond political 
"considerations and support Taiwan’s professional, pragmatic, and meaningful "
participation in the UNFCCC. We therefore register our call for Taiwan help do 
its part in the global fight against climate change. 
          
          
"Finally, Eswatini commits to advance negotiations under the UNFCCC process "
"to reach an ambitious, inclusive, balanced, rules-based and durable outcome at "
this COP. 
          
          
I thank you Mr. President. May God the Almighty bless us all.

"Excellencies, distinguished delegates, on behalf of His"
"Excellency  Mr.  Adama   Barrow,  President  of the"
"Republic  of the Gambia, | wish to extend my sincere"
gratitude and appreciation to the Prime Minister and the
 government and  people of the  United Kingdom   for
 hosting COP26 amidst COVID-19.

 We must build on the enthusiasm shown by world leaders
 in 2015. The realities of climate change have gone beyond
 doubt and debate. The  most vulnerable countries are
 bearing the bruntofits impact.


" In the Gambia, two recent wind storms occurred in July"
 and  September  2021  causing terrible destruction to
 properties and claimed many innocent lives. In addition
" to the storms, disruptionsin rainfall at the beginning ofthis"
 year’s rainy season resulted in delayed planting of vital
 crops in manyareasin the country.


  In 2014 we askedthe following questions:

  Page 2 of 6
"  1) “If urgent action is not taken now, when shall we take"
    them?

  2) When shall we act to reduce global greenhouse gas
    emissions”?

These  questions in my view still remain unanswered.
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other
commitments to the Paris Agreement are not sufficient
enoughto limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. Certainly
not enoughto protect the lives of vulnerable communities
in many developing countries around the world!


"As developing nations, | believe that we are doing more"
than our fair share in combatting global warming. The
Gambia  even though a small developing country in sub-
"Sahara Africa do recognize the severity of climate change,"
and never becamehesitantto ratify the Paris Agreement
 and submitted herfirst and second NDCs. The Gambia’s
 updated NDC  is recognized by Climate Action Tracker
 as  a  fundamental commitment   to  reducing global
 temperature rise to1.5°C above business as usual by

"2050. On behalf of Government, | would like to thank"
"UNDP,  IRENA  and ICLEIfor contributing financially and"
technically to the updating process of the NDC.

In our national drive towards strengthening resilience and
"adaptation measures to climate change, the Government"
of the Gambia is progressively implementing its climate
change  policy aimed at  mainstreaming and  building
"resilience of communities to climate change, together"
working with the United Nations Capital Development
Fund (UNCDF)  Local Adaptation Facility to strengthen
rural communities’ resilience to climate change through
"jobs, skills and finance."


"My   country firmly believes that other governments,"
"particularly the world’s rich and developed countries,"
should do more and honour their past pledges to meet the
 unquestionable and dire needs of the world’s poorest and
" most climate vulnerable people, especially those with the"


 Page 4 of 6
least resilience who are put at the greatest risk from an
ever-changing and unpredictable climate.


"| and my delegation, expect nothing less from COP26 than"
tangible commitments that strengthen emission reduction
targets to be consistent with 1.5°C and reflect each
country’s fair share of the global effort.


"Without  additional finances, investments  in  new"
"technologies and strong capacities, my country will find it"
extremely difficult to implement our ambitious climate
action plan.


We  must not leave Glasgow without a robust and effective
 rule set for the Paris Agreementand this includes: a post-
 2025 climate finance goal; ensure support to address loss
 and damage  as well as recognize the special needs and
 circumstances of the LDCs. Let’s rememberthat our lives
 and livelihoods depend on the decisions wewill make here

  Mr. Chairman: 

  COP 26 is the opportunity we must deliver on to keep 1.5 
  alive!  

  It  is the opportunity  to  take  the  necessary  actions  that  will 
"  ensure  the  survival  of  small  island  developing  states,  and "
  other  vulnerable  countries  already  suffering  from  the 
  devastating impacts of climate change. 

  It is the opportunity to provide hope to our young men and 
"  women, and to the generations to come. "

"     • To  safeguard  their  futures…...their  homes,  …...their "
       communities…..and their livelihoods. 


1
 
 

Small island states have sounded the alarm for decades on the 
need to address climate change.  

We have been consistent for over a decade on the need to limit 
warming to below 1.5 degrees and are pleased to see that at 
"last,  the global  community  now  united  behind  this "
goal. 

We have heard the pledges and the promises. We now need to 
have these backed by action. 

"Action on adaptation and resilience building, with the scaling "
up of adaptation finance to at least double current levels. And 
dedicated financing for loss and damage.  

We need to mobilize and deploy the promised $100bn and the 
trillions needed to support developing countries.  

Glasgow  is  an  opportunity  for  our  global  community  to 
"respond with unity and solidarity, and we call on all parties to "
step up to the plate.  

We acknowledge that the transformation that is required will 
have its challenges and call for a just transition that leaves no 
one behind. 

We have 3 days left to complete our work here and there is still 
a  lot  of  heavy  lifting  to  be  done. But  let’s  be  absolutely 
clear - we cannot leave Glasgow without having done 
"enough  to  keep  the  1.5 goal  within  reach,  and "
satisfactory outcomes on adaption and finance.  

And  make  no  mistake.   The  world  is  going  to  judge  the 
outcomes of COP26 like never before.  

2
          
 

We  must  seize  this  opportunity  to  show  that  we  have  the 
"courage to take the decisive, ambitious and urgent actions that "
we all know are so desperately needed……...I thank you.

Presidents of the Subsidiary Bodies. 
Distinguished delegates 
General public 
 
I am the bearer of greetings from millions of Guatemalans who live in the country 
of  the eternal spring. 
 
"Today, as Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of Guatemala, and in "
my capacity as president pro tempore of the Central American Commission of  
"Environment and Development of the Central American Integration System, I "
"ratify  our  condition  as  a  highly  vulnerable  region  to  atmospheric  effects,  as "
"reflected by  the German watch Global Climate Risk Index, which places at least "
three  Central  American  countries  among  the  10  most  affected  by  extreme 
"weather-related events in the last two decades, and Guatemala is one of them. "
"In addition, the Report of the National Intelligence Council of the United States, "
places Guatemala among the 11 most vulnerable countries in the world to the 
effects of Climate Change. Among the factors that affect us are our geographic 
"location, poverty rates and social conditions. "
 
The reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have confirmed 
that natural phenomena represents a serious threat to the food security of the 
"population,  generates  human  migration  and  damages  the  socio-economic "
"dynamics, public finances and governance of our nations. Added to this scenario "
"is the enormous impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, which deepened "
and highlighted the economic and social problems that Guatemalans and Central 
Americans are experiencing. 
 
"Guatemala, has been hit by the effects of climate change with losses in recent "
"decades, of approximately more than six thousand million dollars: given this "
"harsh reality that we are facing, I request that Central America be recognized "
as a highly vulnerable region to the impact of losses and damages imposed by 
natural disasters and the need to opt for financing options that characterize

"for being of easy access and that come in a timely manner, as well as parametric "
insurance that helps us rebuild the damaged infrastructure  as a result of the 
extreme climate change  events. 
 
"At the regional level, we have also worked to formalize before this important "
space  the  request  for  support  to  the  initiative  to  create  in  Guatemala  the 
"Regional Center for Combating Forest Fires, which will promote a prevention "
"strategy  and  a quick response  to  these  events,  through   regional  inter-"
institutional coordination. 
 
"Guatemala is also an example in sustainable forest management, as a result of "
"the  good  work  between  the  central  government,  the  communities  and  the "
support of the international community. The Mayan Biosphere Reserve is made 
"up of more than  two million hectares, it is the greatest example of natural and "
cultural wealth. The 12 current concessions are a model of success that allows 
us to protect biodiversity and generate development. This is an important area 
to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions and to  combat  the  advance  of  climate 
change. 
 
"Likewise, I call on the parties, with a humble and conciliatory spirit, so that the "
"pending  works  at  COP26,  still  under  negotiation,  reach  the  implementation "
"phase and support the technical guidelines, so that the objectives defined in the "
"Agreement of Paris prevail and allows developing and vulnerable countries, such "
"as Guatemala and the Central American region, to respond in accordance with "
"the principle  of  common  but  differentiated  responsibilities,  according  to  our "
current capacities and national circumstances. 
 
"I urge all parties to work at COP26 for a robust and ambitious result, where its "
"implementation is based on a guide with clear rules, which has environmental "
"integrity as a fundamental pillar, to achieve the objective of limiting the increase "
in temperature at 1.5ºCentigrades.

"The post-COVID-19 economic recovery must be socially just, environmentally sustainable, "
"resilient, and climate-neutral in order to achieve the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement "
on a new climate regime and the United Nations Agenda 2030. 
 
Many substantial changes have occurred in our planet and in our lives since COP21 in Paris in 
"2015, requiring more responsibilities and serious commitments from all so that, together, we "
may  face  and  resiliently  adapt  to  these  new  climate  and  socioeconomic realities  in  a 
sustainable manner.   
 
 
"With new global challenges, the need to increase our ambitions in mitigating the effects of "
"Greenhouse Gases, and in promoting the other two Pillars, namely Finance and Adaptation, "
becomes even more urgent. 
 
"Therefore, the developed countries and economies must lead this process by establishing clear "
"and ambitious goals to achieve net zero emissions, that is, carbon neutrality, by 2050. "
 
 
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
 
"On this important occasion, in which we once again meet to rethink the future of our planet "
"and our own existence, I would like to stress that my country, Guinea-Bissau, a country facing "
"severe  threats  from  Sea  Level  Rise,  Coastal  Erosion,  and  other  climate-related  risks,  and "
"numerous extreme vulnerabilities as an African country, a Least Developed Country (LCD), "
"and a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), which contributes only insignificantly to global "
"emissions of Greenhouse Gases under its updated Nationally Determined Contribution, is "
"very clearly committed to a quantified emission-reduction target that covers the main sectors, "
"namely, Agriculture, Forests, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU), Energy, and Waste. "
 
"In addition, we have set another ambitious goal of reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions by "
30% by 2030 as compared to the baseline scenario. 
 
It is also important to note an unconditional goal that my country has set in order to combat 
"climate change, which is to use our own resources to reduce emissions by 10% by 2030 as "
compared to the baseline scenario. 
 
 
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
 
"The COVID-19 Pandemic crisis must not jeopardize the climate financing agenda, and, for "
"Africa, a reliable Green Fund for adaptation as well as the promotion of these three pillars "
"(Ambition,  Adaptation,  and  Finances)  become  even more  important.  We  need  a  more "
"gradual, large-scale multilateral response to address the climate crisis, with the alignment of "
the financial flow at the center of our focus. 
 
"We must reach an agreement on the application of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and on a "
"financial architecture for long-term climate finance, without losing sight of the fact that a "
better implementation of the COP Mandate for agriculture requires awareness of the strong

"with a commitment to maintain a continuous financial engagement, particularly from the "
"largest  emitters,  so  that  everyone  does  their  part  to  ensure  a  healthier  planet  for  future "
generations.

 26TH CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP26) 
       UN FRAMEWORK CONVENTION  
      ON CLIMATE CHANGE (UNFCCC) 
                      
                      
                HOSTED BY 
                  UNFCCC 
                     &   
   GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM 
       
       
            1-2 NOVEMBER 2021
"Your Excellency,  "
 
1. Climate change is a major threat to global prosperity and development … 
    
"   •  Solidarity, partnership, cooperation, global collaboration are key. "
    
"2. With such great natural potential, Indonesia continues to contribute in "
   tackling climate change. 
    
   •   Deforestation rates have fallen significantly… the lowest in the last 20 
       years. 
   •   Forest fires were down by 82% in 2020. 
   •   Indonesia has begun the rehabilitation of mangrove forests covering 
"       an area of 600,000 ha by 2024, the largest in the world. "
   •   Indonesia has also rehabilitated 3 million critical lands between 2010 
       – 2019. 
"   •   The sector which initially contributed 60% of Indonesia's emissions, "
       will reach the Carbon Net Sink by 2030. 
    
"3. In the energy sector, we continue to progress …  "
    
   •   with the development of electric vehicle ecosystem… 
   •   Building Southeast Asia’s largest solar power plant… 
"   •   Utilisation of new and renewable energy, including biofuels… "
   •   and development  of clean  energy-based  industries…  including  the 
       world's largest green industrial park in North Kalimantan.. 
 
"4.  However, these are not enough. "
     
"   •   We, especially as a country with large green areas and regreening "
       potential… 
   •   and as a country with vast seas that have the potential to contribute 
       to carbon sequestration… 
   •   need support and contribution from developed countries. 
          
5. Indonesia will continue to mobilize climate finance and innovative 
"   financing, such as blended finance, green bonds and green sukuk. "
    


2
6. Fulfillment of  climate  finance by developed  country  partners  is  a  game 
   changer  in  climate  change  mitigation  and  adaptation for developing 
   countries. 
     
7. Indonesia itself will be able to contribute faster to the world's Net-Zero 
   Emissions goal. 
 
"   •   The  question  is  then,  how sizeable are  developed  countries’ "
       contributions for us? 
   •   What kind of transfers of technology can be provided? 
   •   What programs can be supported to achieve the SDGs targets that 
       have been hampered by the pandemic? 
 
"8. In addition, carbon market and carbon pricing…must be part of the "
   efforts to address climate change issues… 
     
9. A  carbon economy ecosystem that is transparent and has integrity… 
   inclusive and fair… must be created. 
     
Excellencies… 
     
"10. There is no point in blaming each other, let alone create conflicts. "
    
   •   There is no value in becoming a victor … in a sinking world. 
 
11. In closing  …  at  this  Summit…on  behalf  of  the  Archipelagic  and  Small 
   Island States Forum (AIS)…Indonesia is honored to be able to circulate a 
   Joint  Statement  of  the  Archipelagic  and  Island  States  Forum 
   Leaders. 
     
12. The AIS Forum will continue to promote maritime cooperation and climate 
   action in serving the UNFCCC. 
 
13. Thank you.

"Mr. President, "
"Executive secretary of UNFCCC, "
"Honorable Ministers, "
"Distinguished Delegates, "
Ladies and Gentlemen  
"It is indeed a pleasure to be present in this august meeting, "
"First of all, I would like to inform that my president his excellency Dr Mahammad "
Ebrahim  Raisi  was  very  much  willing  to attend this summit for  not  only  his 
"personal attachment to climate change and environmental issues, but also for the "
legal obligations according on domestic laws and regulation of my government 
to protect the collective right to clean and protect environment of Iranian nation. 
"however, on his behalf I would like to extend his best wishes for the success of "
this conference. 
Mr. president 
The government of Islamic republic of Iran is committed alongside with other 
nations to combat climate change and global warming with the full support of the 
Supreme Leader. The government and Iranian environment department whose 
"head is of the rank of vice president, devise a very ambitious national plan to cope "
"with the consequences of climate change. However, Mr. President, when it comes "
the  international cooperation and  all  stakeholders  globally unfortunately  my 
country faces an obstacle which is economic terrorism.  
Mr. president  
We are facing a relevant questions raised by members of parliament when they 
"are in the legal process of ratification of Paris Agreement, that question is: if the "
Islamic  republic  of  Iran  becomes  the  full  member  of Paris  agreement  while 
unilateral coercive sanction or measures are imposed on the whole country of 
"Iran, how the government would be able to implement its commitments if it is "
unable  to receive any  international assistance being financial or  technical 
assistance from international community. That question still remains unanswered. 
And I put the same question before you Mr. president and all member state around 
this table why blind coercive measures are imposed on my country and few others 
which not only are inflicting sufferings on a nation but also is undermining the 
global efforts to combat climate change to the benefit of the humanity. 
This  is  the  sad  long  story  of taking human  issues as  a  hostage for  political 
objective of a few if not one. 
Thank you  Mr. president 
                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                                        

                               STATEMENT OF  

"       THE HONORABLE PRIME MINISTER ANDREW HOLNESS, ON, MP  "

                                   TO THE  

 WORLD LEADERS SUMMIT OF THE 26TH CONFERENCE OF PARTIES (COP 26)

"Mr President, Excellencies and Colleagues,  "
 
"On  behalf  of the  people  of  Jamaica,  we  thank  the "
Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  for   their strong 
commitment and leadership in hosting this COP 26 within the 
"context  of the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  the excellent "
arrangements that have been made to keep us safe.  
 
"The message is clear, climate change remains a pre-eminent "
priority for global action.  As we have come to appreciate 
"with the pandemic, “no one is safe until everyone is safe”.  So "
too with CLIMATE CHANGE. All countries must act responsibly 
and with ambition to preserve our climate for all inhabitants 
and future generations of our planet. 
 
"For a brief moment, the pandemic shuttered the world and "
"may  have  even   reduced  emissions.   Importantly,  we "
demonstrated  that  the  world  has  the  capacity  to develop 
global solutions in record time when we believe and agree 
that  the  problem  threatens  our  safety  and  security.  The 
pandemic   demonstrated  the  need  for  equity. Equity must 
also be at the heart of our response to climate change. 

                                                  Page 2 of 4 
 
Countries  that  have  profited  the  most  from  carbon  over 
decades  have  a  responsibility  to  provide  others with 
resources and  technology  to  transition  to low  carbon 
economies.  This  was  the  basis  of  the  US$100  billion  a  year 
pledge from developed countries at the Copenhagen COP 
in 2009.  We need a renewed commitment to this pledge. 
 
Allow  me  to  strongly  emphasize  that  without  developed 
"countries meeting this pledge, our national efforts at climate "
resilience  and  low  carbon  development  are  simply 
unachievable.   
 
If we are to have any realistic chance of meeting our climate 
"ambitions,  we  need  financing that  is predictable, less "
"fragmented,   and  easier  to  access. For  Small  Island "
"Developing  States,  with  miniscule  carbon  footprints,  the "
greater need for funding is for protection and recovery from 
disasters as well as for climate adaptation. 
 
 
 


                                                  Page 3 of 4 
 
There are examples; with the help of the World Bank and with 
"grant support from the Governments of the UK, Germany and "
"the  United  States,  Jamaica  became  the  first  small  island "
"state, to independently sponsor a catastrophe bond which "
will  provide  financial protection  against  losses  from 
hurricanes. 
 
"While  climate  change  affects  all  countries,  the  impact  on "
Small Island Developing States is disproportionately greater. 
Climate  Change  threatens  our  very  survival. Meeting  the 
1.5°C target is a matter of life and death for us. We are at a 
pivotal  moment  in  history. All  countries  must  increase  their 
NDCs ambition to get us back on track. Our actions at COP26 
will  determine  whether  the  planet  will  remain  liveable  for 
future generations.  
 
Let us meet this moment with Urgent and Decisive Action.

                   HIS MAJESTY KING ABDULLAH II 
                   CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES 26 
"                       GLASGOW, SCOTLAND  "
                         1 NOVEMBER 2021 
          
     
"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful "
     
Prime Minister 
"Mr President, "
Your Excellencies: 
     
"    Let me begin by thanking the government and the people of the United Kingdom, "
for welcoming this historic Conference. 
     
    And let me thank the dedicated people from across the world who have steadily 
focused on means to counter the climate threat. 
     
    But our gathering here is evidence that the larger international effort has not been 
enough. 
     
"    We see this, not only in extreme events—firestorms, flooding, deadly landslides. "
"But we also see it in the inch-by-inch loss of healthy, essential environment, lands and "
waters that are the lifeblood of billions of people. 
     
"    The  Middle  East  has  been  among  the  hardest-hit  regions.  In  Jordan,  reduced "
rainfalls and high evaporation have combined to a deadly effect. The Jordan River is a 
shadow of what the Bible and our forefathers depicted. The Dead Sea is dropping by 
"more than half a metre a year. Freshwater aquifers are dwindling, and their salinity "
"rising. All this compounds our extreme water scarcity, already under pressure because "
of massive refugee flows. 
     
    This is why Jordan is committed to the climate change fight. 
     
"    When Jordan joined the Paris Agreement in 2015, we set a target of a 14-percent "
"carbon reduction by 2030. And now, we aim to double it over the next nine years, with "
your help. 
     
"    To achieve this, we have identified 32 emission-reduction projects, with a total "
cost of $7.6 billion dollars. 
     
"    The work has begun. Jordan has been a regional pioneer in renewable energy, "
"clean mobility, and other green technologies. We have worked closely with the green-"
"tech industry, and we welcome continued partnership. "
     
    Numerous  solar  and  wind  projects  are  up  and  running.  And  this  sector  will 
"continue to grow, as we plan to export electricity to neighbouring countries. "
     
"    We are closing the water loop, through the optimal use of highly treated water and "
advanced farming methods. 
     
    Other  initiatives  will  enhance  our  resiliency  in  key  areas  such  as  disaster 
"mitigation, carbon recapture, food security, and waste management. We are embarking "
on an ambitious forestation effort to plant 10 million trees over the next 10 years within 
our protected areas. 
     
"    And we are taking steps to care for a unique marine resource, our resilient coral "
"reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba. We have designated a protected nature reserve, and with "
"your  support,  will  be  able  to  leverage  learnings  about  effective  climate  change "
"mitigation and adaptation, by establishing a marine science and research park in Aqaba "
"to help marine areas at risk across the globe, and increase knowledge sharing on water, "
"energy, and environmental research. "
     
"    In all our efforts, international partners have been and will be essential. A key part "
"of this is COP-26 support for developing countries, both to mitigate the destruction "
"caused by global climate change, and to sustain work for a greener, safer future. "
     
"My friends, "
     
    It  will  do  little  good  to  address  the  climate  threat  in  one  place  and  ignore  it 
"elsewhere. Human impact, on a global level, has created the climate crisis, and human "
"action, on a global level, is required to end it. "
     
"    Truly, this is the fight of our lives. And Jordan will continue to play its full part. "
     
    Thank you. 
     
"KENYA’S  STATEMENT  AT  THE  OPENING  PLENARY  OF         COP26,  CMP16, "
"CMA3, SBSTA 52 – 55, AND SBI 52 - 55 "
       

"Your Excellency Mr. Alok Sharma, the President of COP26, Your Excellency "
"Carolina Schmidt, the outgoing President of COP25, Mr Tosi Mpanu Mpanu, "
"Chair  of  the  SBSTA,  Ms  Marianne  Karlsen,  Chair  of  the  SBI,  Excellencies, "
distinguished delegates; 
   1. Kenya  is  glad  to  be  part  of  this  unique  but  critical Twenty-Sixth  Session  of  the 
      Conference  of  Parties  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate 
"      Change  (COP26), the Sixteenth Session  of  The  Conference  of  Parties  Meeting  as "
"      Parties  to  the  Kyoto Protocol  (CMP16), the Sixteenth Session  of the  Conference  of "
"      Parties Meeting as Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA3), as well as the 52nd to 55th "
      Session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 52 - 
      55) and the 52nd to 55th Session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 52 
      - 55). Kenya aligns her position with the statements by the AGN as well as 
      the G77&China. 

"   2. On  the  item  on Special  needs and  special  circumstances  of  Africa, Kenya "
      notes  that  despite  the  fact  that  the African  continent  has very low historical  and 
"      current emissions (accounting  for  about  4%  of  global  emissions),  IPCC  reports "
      demonstrate that Africa is highly vulnerable and impacted by Climate Change. These 
"      have  led  to increased  water  stress,  cyclic  floods  and  droughts,  food  insecurity, "
"      population  displacements,  resource  based  conflicts  among  others.  Africa  has "
"      resource  and  technical  constraints in  addressing  these  vulnerabilities.  In  this  light, "
      Kenya  supports  the  inclusion  of  the item  on “Special  needs  and  special 
      circumstances of Africa” to guide in addressing these needs. 
       
"   3. Regarding the pending items of the Paris Rule Book, we need to ensure that we "
      finalise it at this session.  
         a. On the item on common time-frames; we need to respond to the scientific 
            evidence  that shows  that  more  ambitious  emissions  reduction  is  required  if 
            we  are  to  achieve  the  Paris  Agreement  goal  of  1.50C. We  need  to  avoid 
            locking-in low ambition over a long period of time.  In the basic structure 
"            of the Paris Agreement, the common thread that runs through the Paris "
"            Agreement,  both  in  NDC  and  Global  Stocktake,  is a  5-year  cycle.  In  this "
"            regard, Kenya therefore appeals to Parties to agree on a 5-year common "
            time frame. 
"         b. On Matters relating to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement,    "
               i. Kenya supports the use of cooperative approaches referred to in 
"                  Article  6,  paragraph  2, with  the application  of  corresponding "
                  adjustments to avoid double counting in the use of ITMOs towards 
                  NDCs  and  for  other  purposes (outside  the  NDCs).  For  consistency 
"                  purposes,  the  ITMOs  should  be  measured  in  tCO2e,  and  be  in  the "
                  form of emissions by sources and removals including by sinks. There 
                  is need  for a  share  of  proceeds (preferably  of  5%) to the 
                  Adaptation  Fund  to  address  concrete  adaptation  needs  of 
                  vulnerable populations at the grassroots  
"               ii. Regarding the mechanism established by Article 6, paragraph "
"                  4, Kenya supports the transition of Kyoto Protocol mechanism, CDM, "
                  projects  and  programme  of activities  into  the  new  Article  6.4 
               mechanism  subject  to  meeting  Art  6.4  requirements  as  well  as  the 
               host  Party  authorization  and  that  they  should  undergo  an  expedited 
               registration process. Kenya supports the application of corresponding 
"               adjustment  for  Article  6.4  units  that  are  internationally  transferred, "
               and that activities with removals by sinks should be included. Kenya 
               reiterates the need for the application of the share of proceeds levied 
               from Art 6 to be towards the Adaptation Fund.  
           iii. Regarding  the  framework  for  non-market  approaches 
"               referred  to  in  Article  6,  paragraph  8, Kenya  supports  the "
               establishment of a concrete implementation framework to implement 
               the  framework  and  work  programme  under  non-market  approaches. 
               Kenya’s  view  is  that  Non-market  activities  can  include  Forestry 
               activities  that  unlock  funding  from  Payment  for  Ecosystem  Services 
               (PES)  Kenya  supports  the  development  of  implementing  tools  for 
               example  a  UNFCCC web-based  platform  for  exchanging  information. 
               Kenya’s  view  is  that  the  Non-market  approaches  can  build  on  the 
               outputs of Koronovia Joint Work on Agriculture such as methodologies 
               that  can  lead  to  replicable  and  scalable  projects  and  programmes 
               across Parties.   
"      c. On  reporting  under  the Transparency Framework,  in  order  to  spur "
"         confidence  and  provide  the  desired  leadership  in  climate  action,  Kenya "
         reiterates  that Developed  countries  have  an  overarching  obligation  to 
         adequately  and  transparently  report climate  finance  provided  and 
"         mobilized, as  well  as their  greenhouse  inventories in  a  time.  Overall, "
         there  is  need  to  clear  existing  ambiguity  in  the climate  finance  architecture 
"         around the definition, modalities and methodologies used in order to enhance "
         transparency in reporting. 
4. Concerning  the  items  on Market  and  non-market  mechanisms  under the 
"   Convention, Kenya’s view is that this item should be deferred till after Article 6 is "
"   finalized, and proposes that they be deferred to SBSTA 56. Once Article 6 is agreed "
   on Parties will still need to deliberate whether to conclude it or what it will do moving 
   forward without overlapping with Article 6. 

"5. Regarding Climate  Finance,  the determination  of  needs  of  developing "
   countries should  inform  the  on-going  discussions  in  setting  the new  post-2025 
   climate finance goal to enable it respond to needs of developing countries. COP 
   26 should initiate the post-2025 new collective goal on climate finance based 
"   on these needs, as well as science. The report should set precedence to a new "
   era  of  needs-based  and  impactful  climate  financing.  Reporting  on  financial 
   support  provided  and  mobilized  by  developed  countries  should  reflect  the  actual 
"   support  received  for  climate  action  in  developing  countries,  including  the "
   instruments.  Kenya is  concerned  that  developed  countries  have not delivered on 
   the $100bn  per  year finance goal and  any efforts  post-2020  should  deliver  on 
   the short falls so far and meet the $100bn per year through to 2025.  
"6. Regarding  on  the  Koronivia  Joint  work  on  Agriculture, Kenya  welcomes  all "
   the workshop reports on the Koronivia Joint work on Agriculture road map this far 
   and  is  ready  to  engage  on  the  actionable  recommendations  thereof  for 
"   implementation  and  institutionalization  of  the  KJWA.  However, on modalities for "
"   implementation  of  the  workshop  outcomes of  the  previous  workshops,  the "
"   KJWA  topics  and  the  future  topics,  Kenya  expresses  her  disappointment  that "
   discussions on the subject have been strong on technical aspects and less on 
   implementation.  Kenya  calls  upon  all  parties  to  consider  the  critical  importance 
"   that agriculture plays in our economies, livelihoods and in ensuring food security and "
   agree on modalities to support the implementation of the outcomes of the past ten 
   workshops  since  2013  to  date. Kenya  therefore  calls  for adoption  of  a  COP 
   decision at COP26 that (i) establishes KJWA as a Constituted Body or Committee 
   under the Convention or (ii) establishes an International Agriculture Program within 
   the UNFCCC process or (iii) requests for establishment of a Requests for Proposals 
   (RFP)  mechanism  under  the  Green  Climate  Fund  (GCF)  that  sets  aside  a  sum  of 
   money  dedicated  to  support  developing  countries  to  submit  proposals  geared 
   towards  implementation  of  the  outcomes  of  the  KJWA  on  issues  related  to 
   agriculture  or  (iv) a  combination  of  both  the  three  above. Kenya  subsequently 
"   proposes  that KJWA  Future  Topics,  should  be  subject  to  adoption  of a  COP "
   decision on modalities for implementation of the workshop outcomes so as 
   to ensure that there is a balance between technical work and implementation of its 
   outcomes. 
"7. On the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures, "
   Kenya  proposes  that  the  KCI  should  provide  a  support  infrastructure  to  enable 
   experts carry out technical assessments of impacts of the response measures. Kenya 
   proposes that Parties should develop mechanisms for (i) retooling and retraining of 
   workers  and  professions  affected  by  response  measures (ii)   cushion  developing 
   countries that have fossil fuel resources from lost opportunities due to forgoing the 
   exploitation of fossil fuel resources in order to avoid the anticipated greenhouse gas 
   emissions  (iii)  cushion  developing  countries  that  had  invested  in  infrastructure  to 
"   exploit their fossil fuels, so as to relieve them of the dead assets burden (iv)cushion "
   consumers  of  goods  that  may  become  expensive  to  the  consumers  as  a  result  of  
   new or expensive technology alternatives to high emitting BAU grey technologies (v) 
"   incentivize  the  creation of green  well  paying  jobs,  profitable businesses,  affordable "
   quality green products and strengthen the associated value chains. 
    

8. Concerning the Warsaw  International  Mechanism  for  Loss  and  Damage 
"   associated  with  Climate  Change  Impacts,  Kenya  calls  for  scaled  up  new  and "
   additional  finance  for  loss  and  damage  with  separate  accounting/reporting 
"   modalities.  Kenya  recognises  the  impact  of  loss  and  damage  on  women,  youth, "
"   children, people abled differently and other vulnerable groups and call for integration "
"   of these groups in the WIM’s work. Kenya supports that, the WIM be governed by "
   both  the  COP  and  CMA  but  not  limited  to  CMA  alone.  It is  Kenya’s  view  that  the 
   Santiago  Network’s  function  should  go  beyond  technical  support  and  capacity 
   building to include resource mobilisation for loss and damage. We therefore call for 
   full operationalization of the Santiago Network to enable it to catalyse the technical 
   assistance  to  developing  countries  that  are  particularly  vulnerable  to  the  adverse 
   effects of climate change to tackle loss and damage. There is need to enhance the 
   scope  of  the  SNLD’s  technical  support  for  accessing  means  of  implementation  to 
   develop and implement approaches to address loss and damage. 
    
"9. Regarding  the Local  Communities  and  Indigenous  Peoples  Platform, Kenya "
"   reiterates  the  value  of  indigenous  knowledge  in  addressing  climate  change, "
   especially in the African context. Kenya calls for the completion of items in the work 
   plan and urges Parties to consider support for the implementation of the outcomes 
   from  the  Platform  so  that  the  platform  doesn’t  stagnate  at  being  a  just  a  Parties’ 
   talk-shop. 

"10. On Matters relating  to  the  Adaptation  Fund, concerning  the Membership  of "
"   the Adaptation Fund Board, Kenya welcomes the decision that allowed all Parties "
   that  are  Parties  to  the  Paris  Agreement  to  be  eligible  for  membership  on  the 
"   Adaptation Fund Board. However, Kenya feels that this inclusion should not alter the "
   current  balance  in  the  composition  of  the  Board  where  developing  country  parties 
   are  the  majority.   Kenya  therefore  feels  that  there  is  no  need  to  reconsider  the 
"   structure  of  the  AFB.  Regarding  the Fourth  review  of  the  Adaptation  Fund, "
   Kenya’s feels that there is need to carry out a comprehensive backward and forward 
   looking review of the AF  so as  to (i) reflect lessons learnt and chart a way forward 
   (ii) strengthen the AF secretariat operations to effectively serve the PA; and Kenya 
"   feels  that  there  is  need  to  focus  on  strengthening  AF  regional  engagements,  with "
   regional nodes to support establishment and strengthening of NIEs 

"11. On  the Development  and  transfer  of  technologies, Kenya  reiterates  the "
   importance  of  technology  as  a  key  pillar  to  climate  action. Regarding  the joint 
   annual  report  of  the  Technology  Executive  Committee  and  the  Climate 
"   Technology Centre and Network, Kenya welcomes the 2020 Joint Annual Report "
   (JAR) of the Technology Mechanism (TM) and acknowledges the achievements of the 
   TM  in  the  difficult  period  under  review  including  the  encouraging  outcome  of  the 
   collaboration between the Technology Mechanism and the operating entities of the 
   Financial mechanism among other achievements. Kenya is in great need of deploying 
   low carbon climate resilient technologies and looks forward to the continued support 
   of the TM in satisfying this need for the implementation of its plans and strategies 
   for its development and for the achievement of the objectives of the Convention and 
   the Paris  Agreement.  Predictable  financial  support  to  the  CTCN  is  a  concern  that 
   Kenya  would  like  to  be  promptly  addressed. Regarding  the Alignment  between 
   processes pertaining to the review of the Climate Technology Centre and 
"   Network and the periodic assessment, Kenya appreciates the importance of the "
   processes  in  enhancing  the  effectiveness  of  the  technology  mechanism  for  its 
   continued operation for the benefit of developing countries. The alignment process 
   should ensure retention of the value it adds to the effectiveness of the Technology 
   Mechanism in carrying out its mandates in the implementation of the convention and 
   the  Paris  Agreement;  and  in  ensuring  timeliness  and  harmony  with  other  critical 
   events  of  the  convention  and  agreement. Regarding  the Poznan strategic 
"   programme on technology transfer, Kenya appreciates specific guidance so far "
   provided to the CTCN in its collaboration with the African Development Bank and the 
   Global  Environment  Facility  to  establish  a  useful  way  forward  with  respect  to  the 
"   Africa regional energy centres, based on the lessons learned; and calls for elaborate "
   engagement  on  the  same.  Concerning  the Linkages  between  the  Technology 
"   Mechanism and the Financial Mechanism of the Convention, Kenya maintains "
   that this agenda item be retained given that the positive results of the linkages are 
   now being realised as a result of guidance previously provided; hence the need to 
   continue providing guidance for attainment of optimal levels of output. 

"12. On Matters relating to capacity-building, regarding Capacity-building under "
"   the Convention, Kenya takes note of the fourth review and welcome the initiation "
   of the fifth review of the framework for capacity-building in countries with economies 
   in  transition.  Kenya  urges  the  SBI  continue  to  monitor  and  report  on  the 
   implementation  of  the  framework  for  capacity-building  in  developing  and  SBI 
   deliberation of the key findings in thee Durban Forum on capacity-building and the 
   meetings  of  the  PCCB. It  is  Kenya’s  view  that  the PCCB  should  then  enhance 
   coherence  and  coordination  of  capacity-building  efforts  and  ensure  that  identified 
"   capacity  gaps  and  needs,  both  current  and  emerging,  and  recommendations  are "
"   addressed in a timely manner. On Capacity-building under the Kyoto Protocol, "
   Kenya  welcomes  the  initiation  of  the  fourth framework  for  capacity-building  in 
   developing  countries  and  the  fifth  review of the  framework  for  capacity-building  in 
   countries with economies in transition. Kenya urges continual support to developing 
   countries  on  capacity  building  on current  and  emerging  areas  especially  matters 
   relating to Article 6 and 13 of the Paris agreement. On Matters related to Action 
"   for  Climate  Empowerment,  regarding  the Review  of  the  Doha  work "
"   programme on Article 6 of the Convention, Kenya takes note of the suggested "
   elements for the review Doha work programme and in particular the continuation of 
"   annual  in-session  ACE  dialogues,  organization  of  youth  forum  ,  development  & "
   implementation  of  ACE  strategies. Kenya  supports a robust  and  balanced 
"   implementation of the 6 priority areas (Education, training, public awareness, public "
"   access  to  information,  public  participation,  and  international  cooperation). It  is  our "
   view that the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism and other development 
   financial institutions to dedicate specific funding for ACE activities. There is need for 
"   strengthening the network of ACE national focal points to exchange views, including "
   via a platform or regular meetings. 

"13. Regarding Report on activities related to Action for Climate Empowerment, "
"   Kenya  takes  note  of  the  8th  ACE  Dialogue,  and  encourages  the  Youth  under "
"   YOUNGO,  ACE  Focal  Persons  to  continue  with  their  meetings  and  events.  Kenya "
"   notes that the ACE forum has multiple benefits, including being a driver of climate "
"   action,  and a  tool  for  achieving  climate  targets,  a  hub  for  multilevel,  multi-"
   stakeholder  collaboration  and  a  source  of  innovation  and  new  ideas  for  climate 
   action. 

"14. It  is  therefore  Kenya’s  hope that this  Conference  avails a  great opportunity, not "
"   just  to richly exchange  of  views, but  to make bold decisions that  will  spur "
   accelerated climate action and enable us achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
   Thank you all.

                            *** 
 
"Distinguished Heads of States and Governments, "
"Distinguished Secretary General of the United Nations, "
"Mr. Chairman, "
                              
At the outset I wish to thank the government of the United Kingdom and 
the government of Italy for convening this conference amid the current 
global epidemiological situation.  
 
"Kyrgyzstan, like the rest of the world, is looking forward to the outcomes "
"of the Glasgow summit. In recent years, our country’s environment and "
people  have  begun  to  suffer  from  the  negative  impacts  of  climate 
change. 
 
"In this regard, let me reassure you that Kyrgyzstan is committed to the "
spirit and goals of the Paris Agreement. 
 
"In spite of the difficulties in its implementation, we remain very optimistic.  "
 
Kyrgyzstan will continue participating responsibly and fully in the global 
campaign to slow down climate change by implementing the Nationally 
Determined Contribution until 2030. 
 
"Dear Heads of Delegations, "
 
By 2030 Kyrgyzstan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by forty-
four percent (44%). 
 
"Currently, our country's share in the global emission is negligible, about "
zero point zero three percent (0.03%). 
 
"The  emissions’  nature  is  not  industrial,  but  rather  related  to  human "
activity. 
 
We  estimate  that  the  implementation  of  the  necessary  medium-term 
mitigation actions to cost 7 billion US dollars. 
 
"By  2050,  Kyrgyzstan  aims  to  reach  carbon-neutrality  on  the  basis  of "
green development. 
 
"Renewable  energy,  especially  hydropower,  will  be  the driver  of  the "
carbon-free economic development. 
 
We  intend  to  develop  small  and  medium  hydropower  projects  with  a 
"view of shifting industry, housing and utilities infrastructure to electricity "
"consumption  at  the  expense  of  the  carbon-based  energy  sources, "
"primarily  coal  and  heating  oil,  without  any  negative  impact  on  the "
environment. 
 
"Presently,  ten  small  and  medium  hydropowerplants  are  being "
constructed. Some of them have already been operational. The rest will 
be ready by the end of the next year. 
 
"In accordance with the Paris Agreement spirit, I invite private investors "
from developed economies to cooperate with us in the hydropower 
"sector, also using public-private partnership schemes. "
 
"Without advanced technology, innovation and know-how transfer, timely "
and simultaneous achievement of green economic growth and carbon 
neutrality in Kyrgyzstan will be difficult. 
 
"In this regard, I call on all stakeholders, especially international "
"multilateral banks, climate funds and corporations, to have serious "
discussion with us. 
 
"Dear ladies and gentlemen, "
 
"It is vital for Kyrgyzstan not only to preserve its ancient glaciers, water "
"resources and celestial mountains from climate change, but also protect "
from  abusive  economic  activities  that  unfortunately  are  the case  in  our 
"country.  In  this  regard,  I  urge  the  international  community  to  work "
together against such unacceptable business practices. 
 
In  areas  of  adaptation  we  are  carrying  out  programs  and  projects  in 
"vulnerable  sectors  such  as  agriculture,  water  resources,  energy, "
"industry, disaster risk mitigation, public health, forests, and biodiversity. "
 
"Given that ninety-four percent (94%) of our territory is mountainous, the "
scope of work to be done is immense. 
 
We estimate adaptation measures to cost nearly 3 billion US dollars. 
  
 
Dear Summit participants! 
 
The described problems from the negative effects of climate change are 
in many ways common for mountainous countries. 
 
"Their Governments, including that of Kyrgyzstan, may need donor "
assistance to address them.  
 
"In this regard, we propose to foresee and include in the Glasgow "
outcome decisions the targeted funding arrangements for developing 
mountainous countries in need of assistance. 
 
We propose under the auspices of the UN to establish a Special Fund to 
implement  needs  tailored  adaptation  programs  with focus  on  the 
"conservation of glaciers, forests and biodiversity, enhancing disaster risk "
"preparedness,  and  socio-economic  support  to  mountainous "
"communities, especially women and children. "
 
"In my opinion, the era of long and pretty speeches is over. It is time to "
"act purposefully, consistently and effectively. "
 
"In conclusion, I wish to stress that we can only solve our problems by "
working together. 
 
 
Thank you for your attention!

"Mr. President, "
"Excellencies, "
"Ladies and gentlemen, "


 
"At the outset, on behalf of the government of the Lao PDR, I would like to express our sincere "
"appreciation to the Government of the United Kingdom, in partnership with Italy, for their great "
effort to host this meaningful Conference despite challenges caused by the on-going COVID-
19 pandemic.  
"Mr. President, "
The Lao PDR has attached great importance to combating climate change. We are committed 
to implement the Paris Agreement by incorporating its relevant provisions into our National 
Socio-Economic  Development  Plan and National  Green  Growth  Strategy while  promoting 
international cooperation and engagement of relevant stakeholders.  
"Early this year, the Lao government has revised our Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) "
that clearly outlines ambitious targets of the national actions for tackling and mitigating climate 
change  toward  achieving  net-zero  emissions  by  2050. We  have  also set out lofty  goals to 
"achieve by 2030 which include, among others, reducing the greenhouse gas emissions by 60 "
"percent, increasing forest cover to 70% of total land area, promoting increased use of renewable "
"and clean energy through a 30% share of electric vehicles, 10% biofuel, and improving water "
management practices.  
"In  order  to  translate our NDC  into  reality,  there  is  a pressing need  for  adequate  financial "
"resources,  including  enhanced financial and  technical support and  assistance from the "
international  community  especially development  partners.  It  is  our  firm  belief  that gaining 
access  to  climate  finance  and  other  sources  of  funding is crucial to  supporting developing 
"countries,  especially  LDCs, LLDCs and  SIDS to  achieve  their development  goals  and "
commitments made under the Paris Agreement.  
 
"Mr. President,  "
Having recognized the paramount importance of promoting clean and renewable energy and 
"the role of forest cover as a pathway to decouple greenhouse gas emissions, the government of "
"Lao PDR has further initiated several measures and policies, including the recent announcement "
"of policy on the use of electric vehicles, the allocation of 16.5 million hectares as forestland to "
increase forest cover as well as the plan to develop a 600-megawatt wind power plant which is 
the first cross-border electricity interchange from wind power generation in the region.  
"In addition, we have implemented the Safe Clean Climate Resilient Hospital Initiative to further "
promote low carbon environmentally sustainable technology as well as green procurement and 
supply.  This  is  the  first  significant  step  by  the  health  sector  to  begin  developing  plan  for 
"implementing low-carbon, resilient health care. "
"Mr. President, "

Let  me conclude by reiterating the  Lao PDR’s firm commitment to undertake urgently our 
common  task  of combating climate  change through vigorously  implementing  the  Paris 
Agreement in collaboration with all stakeholders and by call for strong political will coupled 
with concrete actions taken by all Parties to curb the rise in global greenhouse gas emissions 
and limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius as set out in the Paris Agreement.  
"Last  but  not  least, I  would  like  to  express  my  heartfelt  gratitude  and  appreciation  to  the "
international community for continued support and assistance to the Lao PDR for our efforts 
towards the climate change adaptation and mitigation. 
                              I thank you.

                 NATIONAL STATEMENT

                           BY

HIS EXCELLENCY DR. GEORGE MANNEH WEAH
        PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA

                         AT THE

26TH UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE


"                 GLASGOW, SCOTLAND"
                 THE UNITED KINGDOM

"                   NOVEMBER 1, 2021"
1


"Excellencies, Heads of State and Government;"
"Her Excellency Madam Clar Marie Weah, First Lady of the"
Republic of Liberia;
Your Excellency the Secretary General of the United Nations;
The President of the 26th United Nations Climate Change
Conference;
Heads of International Organizations;
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen;:

This year’s COP26 is taking place at a time when the world is
having to learn to live with the devastating and disruptive
consequences of the deadly Coronavirus pandemic. Climate
"change, like COVID-19, presents an even bigger threat to the"
world and to our common humanity. 

We have therefore gathered here at this 26th United Nations
Climate Change Conference to seek common action to save our
"planet, and bring equity and fairness to how we achieve these"
objectives under the Paris Accord on Climate Change. 
2


"Upon taking the leadership of my country in 2018, one of the first"
major steps that I took was to ensure the ratification of the Paris
Agreement in that same year.  This was a demonstration of my
Government’s highest political commitment to ensure that Liberia
is among the comity of nations working together in addressing the
challenges of climate change.

"In June of this year, I convened a National Climate Change and"
Environment Conference to mobilize my citizens and partners in
working together to urgently address the critical issue of climate
change and environment. Liberia’s Revised Nationally
Determined Contributions were presented and adopted at that
"Conference, and have subsequently been submitted to the UN"
Climate Change Secretariat. 
 
"Your Excellencies, we welcome the U.S. Government back to the"
"Paris Agreement, and urge strong U.S. leadership and"
commitment in placing the world on a path to meeting our climate
"change targets, and in assuring fairness and equity among"
advanced and developing countries.
3


Liberia therefore looks forward to joining  and leading in the  U.S.
"Government’s Conserve Global Forest / Carbon Sink Program,"
and to joining similar programs launched by other advanced
nations. 
 
With the largest forest cover of more than 43% in the Equatorial
"Guinea rainforest, Liberia serves as a major hub for carbon"
"sequestration. This natural endowment is a buffer not only for us,"
but the larger world. We are a major part of the global lungs which
make it possible for the industrial world to breath. 

"It is our intention to maintain these forests in prime condition, and"
that is why we have outlined in our Revised Nationally
Determined Contributions specific climate-resilient and
adaptation measures that we are determined to implement in
order to guarantee the wellness of these global lungs.
4


"Since signing the Paris Accord, Liberia has lived up to its promise"
to reduce deforestation from logging and timber production and
"from agriculture. We have expanded our protected forests, and"
we are prepared to protect more forests and to intensify our work
with local communities to expand their options for food and fuel in
order to reduce pressure on forest resources. 

"However, is this high level of forest conservation paying off for"
Liberia?
 
"EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:"

We are all aware that there is an inherent imbalance in the current
"architecture of climate financing. Countries like Liberia, who"
maintain and protect the largest remaining tracts of forest
"reserves, receive the lowest benefits for these ecosystem"
services.  We who are the richest in terms of forest resources and
"biodiversity, are the poorest in terms of socio-economic"
development.  
5


"Although we bear the brunt of the impact of climate change, we"
benefit the least from the existing solutions and financial
arrangements currently in place for tackling climate change.

"In order to address this imbalance, there needs to be a"
fundamental shift in the way we tackle this mismatch in climate
investments today.

I believe that one of the ways that this can be done is to establish
an African Carbon Credit Trading Mechanism.  With your
"support, Liberia will be willing to host a conference in the near"
future to explore the details and structure of such an entity.  We
will work with pan-African and other global financial institutions to
develop a long-term regulated market for African carbon credit.

I am convinced that these initiatives will increase the chances for
all African countries that depend on their forest reserves to attain
sustainable economic growth and national development in line
with the vision set out in the 2030 Agenda.
6


 
"Excellencies, accessing climate finance is key for Liberia in order"
to achieve our revised climate change ambitions. Even as we
recognize the roles of the various climate financing mechanisms
"such as the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility,"
"Adaptation Fund and many others, we must acknowledge that"
there is a huge gap in climate investments today. We therefore
need to re-imagine what a successful future looks like in climate
"financing,  and this will require fundamental shifts in the way we"
think. 

"Therefore, even as we intensify our ecosystem protection, we are"
determined to join other forested countries in Africa to expand
resources available to us for achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals. 

"Here at COP 26, we must find a strategic balance between"
"mitigation and adaptation on the one hand, and commitment to"
climate financing on the other hand. Developed countries must
"translate the principle of leaving no one behind into action,"
through the mobilization and scaling up of capital flows for energy
development and energy transition for the African continent.
7


We as global leaders must collectively adopt a new mindset of
"appropriate and urgent action in the fight against climate change,"
that will fully address the three goals of the Paris Agreement:
"Mitigation, Adaptation and Finance for a net-zero carbon emission"
by 2050. 

"Together, we can make a difference as a shared community of"
global citizens with a common destiny. Together we can heal the
"world from the scourges of climate change. Together, we can"
save this earth from the deadly consequences of global warming. 
"Together, we can bring humankind into harmony with nature."

I thank you.

"Mr. President, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, "
            

I would like to welcome the United Kingdom government as the new 
COP-26 Presidency and for the arrangements and hospitality extended 
during this conference in Glasgow.  
            
"Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, "
            
Taking  into  account the serious impact of global  warming  and  the 
"unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Malaysia "
recognises the urgency to build back better through green recovery. 
    
"In this regard, Malaysia had communicated its updated NDC to reduce "
its  economy-wide  carbon  intensity  (against  GDP)  of  45%  in  2030 
compared to 2005 level. The 45% of carbon intensity reduction target 
is unconditional and is an increase of 10% from the earlier submission. 
"In  addition,  Malaysia’s  NDC  covers 7 GHG instead  of  3 GHG "
previously. 
    
Malaysia also aspires to achieve net-zero GHG emission target earliest 
"by  2050,  pending  the  completion  of  its  Long-Term  Low  Emissions "
Development Strategy by 2022. 

1
            
    
"To achieve these ambitious targets, Malaysia will be putting forward "
several measures such as: 
    
     1. implementation of carbon pricing policy in phases to support 
        national efforts to reduce GHG emissions; 
    
     2. achievement of 31% of renewable energy capacity for power 
        generation in 2025 and 40% in 2035 in national power grid 
        through its Malaysia’s Energy Transition Plan to 2021 - 2040; 
    
     3. aspiration for 100% of government fleets to be non-internal 
        combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2030; 
    
     4. maintaining at least 50% forest cover as pledged during the 
        Rio Earth Summit 1992; 
    
     5. implementing natural-based  solutions as  a  basis  to  reduce 
        long-term impacts through planting of a 100 million trees; 
            
     6. moving towards  Zero  Waste  directed  to  landfill  through  the 
        Waste to Energy concept and to increase its recycling rate 
        target to 40% by 2025; 
    
     7. transforming cities in Malaysia towards low carbon pathway 
        as outlined under the National Low Carbon City Masterplan; 
        and  
    
     8. increasing long-term resilience towards  climate  change 
        impacts through the development of the National Adaptation 
        Plan.  
    
         
2
            
"In addition, two of our largest energy companies in Malaysia have rolled "
out their plans to achieve net-zero emissions target by 2050.  
 
I am also glad to announce that the Malaysian government has agreed to 
support the Global  Methane  Pledge as  well  as the Glasgow  Leaders 
Declaration on Forests and Land Use.  
 
"Mr. President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, "
 
Malaysia  looks forward  to  the  completion  of the  Paris  Rulebook during 
COP26 to stay on track to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. There 
needs to be a clear modality for NDC implementation and establishment 
of  cooperative  arrangements.  This  should take  into  account 
"environmental integrity and robust accounting. In this regard, Malaysia is "
willing to work with all parties to ensure the success of COP26. 
 
"However, to  implement  the  Paris  Rulebook,  it will  require additional "
"finance,  technology  transfer  and  capacity  building for  developing "
"countries. In this regard, Malaysia urges developed countries to fulfil their "
obligations under the Paris Agreement.  
 
"Lastly, thank you again and congratulations to the Government of United "
Kingdom for hosting this conference.  
 
Thank you.

                                 Statement by: 
                                        
                          The Honorable Bruce Bilimon 
       Minister of Health and Human Services of the Republic of the Marshall Islands 
"               National Statement at COP26, Glasgow, United Kingdom "
                               09 September 2021 
 
 
"Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Honorable Ladies and Gentleman. "
 
I bring you warm greetings & “Iakwe” from the Republic of the Marshall Islands. I am speaking 
to you as a representative of a country under siege from the onslaught of climate change. It is 
already upon us today; it threatens to overtake us in the near future.  
 
The storm of the climate catastrophe is gathering destructive power with every failed promise and 
missed target.  If there were ever a moment for bold and committed leadership - it is now and here 
in Glasgow.  
 
"Mr. President, "
 
We cannot delay adapting to the changing climate any longer.  No country will avoid its effects 
and many countries will suffer irreparable damage. We must not only stay within the 1.5 degrees 
"Celsius limit in order to survive, but prepare to survive the impacts associated with this increase.  "
 
Some of us must act with a greater urgency and consider more extreme measures than others. As 
"a  low-lying  atoll nation, we  know  that  physical  responses,  like  reclaiming  land  and  building "
"seawalls, will take the cost of adaptation into the billions of dollars - and will likely still not be "
enough to protect our country.  If king tide storms and extreme weather events continue to ravage 
"our shores, sea level continues to rise, and as oceans continue to warm and become more acidic, "
"bleaching and destroying our coral that represents our nation's very foundation, we will be left "
with limited options.  
 
"As atoll nations, the failure of others to do what is necessary to tackle climate change forces us to "
grapple with extreme and existential challenges. We will never accept that anthropogenic climate 
"change - which we did not cause – be the basis for a loss of our sovereignty, our sovereign rights, "
or  our  maritime  boundaries.  We  will  preserve  our  nation  and  our  culture  against  any  and  all 


 
 

challenges  that we face. The Marshall  Islands need the support of developed countries  in  this 
"critical undertaking, particularly those that have contributed the most to this crisis.  "
 
"Therefore, we must use COP26 to generate real change in how we address adaptation. We must "
provide the scientific and financial focus it demands.  The Marshall Islands therefore call on all 
donor  nations  and  multilateral  development  partners  to  address  the  extremely  wide  gap  that 
"currently exists between mitigation and adaptation funding, and to ultimately achieve a fifty-fifty "
"split between them. As a first step, a commitment to at least doubling of adaptation financing from "
current levels is essential. 
 
And we must form a strong foundation to ignite a step-change on adaptation movement. Further 
"developing the science on adaptation, and establishing an accurate understanding of the resources "
required to address it. The IPCC Special Report on 1.5 gave us a firm basis for the target agreed 
"in Paris, and a similar analysis on adaptation is needed.  "
 
The science is clear that this is the critical decade for keeping 1.5 in check. We must cut emissions 
in half by 2030 to make this possible and to stay on track. We must all re-commit to this target and 
take urgent action to deliver it.  
 
"G20 leaders: your countries make up 80% of global emissions. The world is watching and we, the "
"vulnerable nations of this world, urgently call you to take action reflecting ambition in enhanced "
NDCs and long-term strategies that align with a 1.5 pathway.  
 
All nations must demonstrate their ambition for this by urgently updating their NDCs to ensure 
"alignment to this 1.5 survival figure.   In Paris, we agreed that countries would be welcomed to "
"submit NDCs at any time. Again, if there is ever a time in which we must act upon this opportunity "
"to increase ambition, to demonstrate this commitment, it is now. We must come back to the table "
"at COP27 with 1.5 aligned NDCs, and keep coming back to the table until we are on a track.  "
 
COP26 here in Glasgow has the power to accelerate an unprecedented shift in the global economy 
"to a post-carbon, and green future. It is already underway, though far too slowly.   "
 
We must put an end to the worst offenders. Coal and super-pollutants must go. We must put an 
end to fossil fuel subsidies; we should not pay for our own destruction. Nonetheless during this 
"COP, and over the past few months, we’ve heard encouraging sentiments from respective leaders "
of the world on the path for collective fight against climate change.   
 
"Critical transport sectors like aviation and shipping keep the global economy moving however, left "
"unchecked, will also spell global destruction. We must reach zero emissions by 2050 in maritime "
"shipping,  and  implement  a  carbon  levy  to  meet  that  target  in  a  way  that  not  only  catalyzes "

2
 
 

"innovation, but also provides crucial resources for the vulnerable. We welcome new opportunities "
that support sustainable ocean-based economies and large scale marine protected areas. 
 
Mr. President 
 
We will not see a safe and secure future that leaves no one behind without resources. The delivery 
"of the $100 billion is vital. And as we initiate discussions on a post-2025 finance goal, we must "
"ensure that we base these discussions on an accurate assessment of needs, and - as always, at the "
heart of our work - the science.   
 
The Paris Agreement Rulebook must be completed in a way that puts ambition and environmental 
integrity at its core.  Article 6 is a critical tool for driving de-carbonization and has the potential to 
provide a predictable funding stream for adaptation. But the wrong system will set us further back 
than we can afford.  
 
"Mr. President,  "
 
We urge fellow Parties to honor and respect their obligations to future generations - to commit to 
"the Kwon Gesh climate pledge, and to involve youth in the self –determined decisions that will "
shape their future. 
 
"The  climate  crisis  will  affect  us  all,  but  some  remain  excluded  from  these  discussions.  The "
"Republic of the Marshall Islands supports Taiwan’s inclusion in the UN system, and their full "
involvement in these discussions that shape their citizens’ lives as much as our own.  
 
"At COP25 in Madrid, we committed to using our newly-secured seat at the Human Rights Council "
"to advance climate justice, and we are proud to play a role in instituting a Special Rapporteur on "
"Climate Change at the Human Rights Council, established at the most recent session.  "
 
"Mr. President,  "
 
"We convene the High Ambition Coalition, and stand ready to support progress at this COP. It is "
"clear that ambition, this year, is not limited to one element of the Paris Agreement, but rather on a "
"package of outcomes on mitigation, adaptation and finance.  "
 
"The  demands,  here  in  Glasgow,  are  highly  ambitious  and  difficult.  Nevertheless,  let  us  come "
together to meet them - - for the sake of our collective future and for the sake of HUMANITY! 
 
Kommol tata & I thank you!

"The Right Honourable Alok Sharma, President of "
COP26 
 
"Excellencies, "

 
The need to limit the rising global temperature below 

1.5 degrees  celsius and  reach  carbon  neutrality  by 

2050 is no longer a desirable objective. It is a critical 

imperative  if  we  want  to  avoid  a  major  catastrophe 

and  hopefully  put back our planet  on  a  sustainable 

course. 

 
"For  small  island  countries  like  Mauritius, global "

warming  and  rising  sea  levels  represent  an 

existential  challenge  which  will  cause  tremendous 

damage and lead to massive displacement of people 

especially from low lying islands. 


                                     Page 2 of 5 
Concrete  action  accompanied by  adequate and 

"predictable funding is, therefore, absolutely essential. "

 
We  all  have  a  responsibility  to  address  this 

challenge and Mauritius is prepared to do its share.  

 
"We, therefore, commit  to  take  actions  that  will "

contribute towards the following: 

  1. Reducing  gas  emissions  by  40 per  cent by 
     2030; 
      
  2. Achieving 60 per cent of green energy in our 
     energy mix by 2030; 
      
  3. Phasing  out  coal  in  electricity  generation 
     before 2030; 
      
  4. Promoting  a  circular  economy  involving  
     70 per cent of waste from landfills by 2030; 
      
  5. Encouraging the use of electric vehicles; and  
      
  6. Promoting  smart  agriculture  and  island  wide 
     tree planting programmes. 

                                     Page 3 of 5 
"These  actions, along  with  several  others, will  pave "

the  way  for  Mauritius to become a  climate  resilient 

and low emission country. 

 
"At the same time, we expect our partners to do their "

share and ensure that the Glasgow package focuses 

on: 

"  1. Enhanced  action on  adaptation,  including "
     financing for adaptation; 
      
  2. Addressing  loss  and  damage caused  by 
     climate change; 
    
  3. Narrowing the emissions gap with new targets 
     for 2030; 
    
  4. Fulfilling  the  $100  billion  a  year  finance 
     commitment and ensuring simplified access to 
"     these funding  by  SIDS,  and  other  vulnerable "
     countries; and 
    
  5. Adaptation and mitigation. 

                                     Page 4 of 5 
These  actions  constitute  the  basic  elements  of  a 

comprehensive  and  global  strategy  to  address  this 

"challenge.  More  particularly, they  will  represent "

restorative justice for the most vulnerable countries. 

 
As  leaders  we  have  a  huge  responsibility  towards 

our  people  and  posterity.  We  have  no  right  to  fail 

them. 

 
Thank you.

      I  wish  to  convey  my  heartfelt  congratulations  to  the  Government  of  the  United 
Kingdom  for  hosting  the  26th session  of  the Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and wish every success to the work 
of the session.  
       
      It  is  universally  acknowledged  that  in  order to  achieve the  goals  of  the  Paris 
"Agreement  by  2050, every  country  needs  to  reconsider  its  efforts and strive together "
through a bold and comprehensive policy. 
       
      This challenging time when the humanity is facing the scourge of the COVID-19 
pandemic reminds us that we need to change our attitude towards nature and take bold 
and decisive measures to accelerate green growth.  
       
 
"      Mr. President,  "
       
"      Mongolia, as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, fully supports "
efforts of  the  international  community to reach  net-zero  emissions  and  reaffirms  its 
commitments to the Paris Agreement and to mobilize every possible resource to fulfill 
them.  
       
"      Mongolia raised its target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a main cause of "
"climate change, to 22.7 per cent by 2030, through updating its Nationally Determined "
Contributions.  
 
      I am pleased to announce from this podium that there is an opportunity to increase 
our  commitment  to  27.2  per  cent  through  introduction  of  advanced  technology  and 
innovation and increase of necessary funding.

"      Mr. President,  "
 
      It is crucial to develop a cross border energy network in the Northeast Asian region 
in order to meet its growing energy consumption and enhance production of renewable 
energy.  
       
      Mongolia supports the Asian Super Grid Initiative for increasing renewable energy 
"sources and improving energy supply in Northeast Asia. Within this framework, we are "
actively collaborating with the  countries  in  the region  to  build  a  large  energy  complex 
based on the vast solar and wind resources of the Gobi region.  
       
"      Taking this opportunity, I would like to underscore that Mongolia has successfully "
organized an International Dialogue on “Mongolia-Green Development” two weeks ago 
in Ulaanbaatar ahead of the COP26 Summit.  
       
"      As a national contribution to combating climate change, Mongolia has launched a "
national campaign to plant billions of trees by 2030 in order to reach net-zero emission 
"targets, reduce poverty or combat desertification through economic means, protect the "
"health  of  children and  women who  are  the most  vulnerable  to  climate  change,  and "
improve overall quality of life.  
       
"      Thus, Mongolia has decided to spend at least 1 per cent of its GDP annually to "
mitigate adverse effects of climate change and desertification. 
       
"       Mongolians say ""the source of life is water and the source of water is tree."" We "
"believe  that  the  implementation  of  planting  billions  of  trees  initiative,  which  is  the "
"manifestation  of  our  traditional  culture  to  care  for nature, will  make  a  significant "
"contribution to reducing dust storms that affect the ecology, health and economy of not "
"only Asia, but also the Americas.    "
       
       
"      Mr. President,  "
       
"      Last but not least, I would like to emphasize the important role of a close regional "
and  international  cooperation  in  increasing  capital  inflows  for  low  and  middle-income 
countries to combat climate change.  
       
"      Only  our  common  understanding,  collaboration, resolve and perseverance are "
"utmost  important to achieve  our  mission to  fight  climate  change,  the  world's  greatest "
"challenge of all time, and have a responsible approach to nature and leave a greener "
world for our descendants. 
        
      It is time for the nations of the world to combine their efforts for this deed.  
       
      I thank you for your attention.

  HIGH LEVEL SEGMENT OF THE TWENTY-SIX CONFERENCE OF 
PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON 
                  CLIMATE CHANGE 
                      (COP 26) 
"             GLASGOW, UNITED KINGDOM "
                   2 November 2021

H.E. Alok Sharma- President of COP 26 

"Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Governments "

Distinguished delegates  

Ladies and Gentlemen 

Climate change and the worsening ecological crisis obey no 
sovereign  boundaries.  COP26  is  the  international 
community’s  last  chance  to  collectively  overcome  the 
disconnect  between  a  divided  international  system  and  a 
global  calamity  that  threatens us  all.  Namibia  is  taking 
transformative steps towards honoring this responsibility.  

"Along with the world, Namibia is experiencing widespread "
and  devastating  impacts  on  key facets of  our  civilization 
including  severe  droughts  to  devastating  field  fires 
destroying  large  tracts  of  our  agricultural  land  adversely 
"impacting, livelihoods, human health and wellbeing.  "

"For this COP negotiations, there are critical objectives that "
are crucial to protect us all from the impacts from runaway 
"climate change, breakdown of the biosphere and the death "
of the world’s oceans. It is hard to overstate the urgency and 
consequence of getting these right.  


                     Page 2 of 6 
        
 

Namibia is committed to the following objectives for COP26. 

1. We aim the conclusion and adoption of a robust Article 6 
  at COP26. This critical step would provide the bedrock of 
  an international carbon market mechanism necessary to 
  drive funds to the places where emissions can be cut most 
"  effectively, to mobilize large scale private investment for "
  climate  action  and  to  drive  crucial  innovation. Article  6 
  cannot wait for another COP.  
   
2. Namibia  supports  the  UN  Secretary’s  General’s  push  to 
  ‘consign coal to history’. Namibia will support the phasing 
  out of coal in our region by significantly scaling up solar 
"  and  wind  energy  to  support  domestic  demand,  whilst "
  working  with  our  neighbors  to responsibly phase  out 
  existing  coal  generation  in  the  Southern  African  Power 
  Pool and transform our region’s energy map. This is the 
  single  most  important  step  to keeping  the  Paris 
  Agreement’s 1.5C target alive.  
             
   


                     Page 3 of 6 
        
   
"3. In our support for scaling up climate finance, we call for "
  the $100  billion target for  climate  finance  needs  to  be 
"  surpassed as a target, with a clear roadmap on how the "
  committed  amounts  will  be  delivered.  We  urge  for  an 
"  increased volume of grants, rather than loans, to make it "
  possible  for  emerging  economies  carrying  high  debt 
  burdens to kickstart transformative projects.  

Namibia  has amplified its 2015  pledge  in the Nationally 
"Determined  Contributions,  we  now  aspire  to  reduce  our "
emissions by 91% before  the  end  of  this  decade. The 
estimated  investment  required to  achieve  this  target is 
"approximately  USD  5.3  billion,  10%  of  which  is "
unconditional.  

These  ambitions are matched  by  the  highest  levels  of 
"political  commitment.  The  green  and  blue  economy, "
"including a green hydrogen industry, are cornerstones of the "

Tomorrow we will announce how Namibia is unlocking over 
"5,700 square kilometers in our Karas region for the potential "
"development  of  green  hydrogen  and  ammonia  assets, "
expected to double the region’s employment and triple the 
installed  renewable  energy  generation  capacity  for  the 
entire country. We are taking these bold steps to enhance 
"our  energy  security, decarbonize our  country, assist  our "
regional and global peers to reduce their emissions and build 
a more resilient economy.  

The  impacts  of  climate  change  continue  to  accelerate  and 
"deepen. In this context, we call on other countries to show "
the highest levels of ambition and commitment possible.  

"In closing, Namibia urges all COP negotiators to finalize the "
"Paris rulebook, take meaningful action in areas of consigning "

I grew up praying for the serenity to accept the things I could 
"not change, sought the courage to change the things in my "
control and the wisdom to know the difference between the 
two.  

Climate Change is something we can all change – let’s muster 
the courage!

"Statement by Rt. Hon. Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister and Leader of "
     Nepali Delegation at the World Leaders Summit during the 26th 
   Conference of Parties (COP 26) of the UN Framework Convention on 
                        Climate Change (UNFCCC) 

"              Glasgow, United Kingdom, 01 November 2021 "

 

"Mr President,  "

"Excellences,  "

I sincerely thank the Government of the United Kingdom for hosting this important 
Conference. 

Nepal remains firmly committed to the implementation of Paris Agreement. We have 
submitted an ambitious NDC that plans to decarbonize our economy in all sectors. 
Nepal aims to reach a net zero emission by 2045. We will ensure that 15% of our total 
energy  demand  is  supplied  from  clean  energy  sources  and  maintain  45%  of  our 
country under forest cover by 2030.  

"Nepal  has recently  approved  the Long-Term Strategy, Framework  for Loss  and "
Damage and National Adaptation Plan. We have a policy to spend at least 80% of the 
available climate finance to support local climate actions. We are reaching the most 
vulnerable communities through our Local Adaptation Plan of Action. With abundant 
"water, forest and biodiversity resources, Nepal can be a leader in sharing clean, green "
and nature-based climate solutions in the region. 

"With temperatures rising higher than global average, glaciers are receding, snowfall "
is  decreasing  and  permafrost  is  melting  in  the  Himalayan  region.  Extreme  climate 
"events  are increasing,  causing  huge loss  to economy,  ecology  and human  lives. "
Around 80% of Nepal’s population is at risk from natural and climate-induced hazards. 
"During the last 40 years, natural disasters have caused close to US$ 6 billion physical "
and economic damages in my country alone.   

"Mr. President,    "

"Rapid  warming  in  the  Himalayas poses  serious  threat  to  food,  water,  energy  and "
human security of the entire region. Glacier melting also contributes to the existential 
threat to the coastal and island countries due to sea level rise.   

"I, therefore, urge the world leaders to recognize the specific climate vulnerability in "
the high mountains and accord high priority to the mountain agenda in all climate-
related negotiations. Keeping the global temperature below 1.5° celcius is vital for 
mountain people. It is an issue of our survival. To raise awareness on the climate crisis 

1
 
"in the Himalayas, my government will host Sagarmatha Sambad – a dialogue named "
after Mt. Everest.   

"An  LDC, Nepal is  making  sincere  efforts  to  balance the development  and  climate "
actions.  We  have  mechanisms  to  ensure  that  international  climate  finance  is 
"channelled to  support  transformational  approaches  in  implementing  adaptation, "
mitigation and disaster management actions together.  

"We are engaging with all stakeholders including private sector, indigenous people, "
"disadvantaged communities, women and youth in all our climate actions. Recognizing "
"the value of nature to both adapt and mitigate climate change, we have decided to "
create a dedicated institution for working on Nature Conservation and Climate Change 
together.  

"Mr. President, "

Loss and damage has become a key concern due to increased phenomena of climate 
induced disasters. This subject must find a place under article 4.8 of the Convention. 
We call upon the Parties to agree on making Loss and Damage a stand-alone agenda 
for negotiations and support the framework of additional financing for it. The COP 26 
must  ensure  adequate  support  for adaptation  in the  most  vulnerable  counties  by 
"scaling up financial, technological and capacity-building resources.  "

"We can deliver on our goals only through quick, direct and easy access to climate "
"finance.  We  urge  the  Parties  to agree  on a  clear  roadmap  for  a  new  collective, "
quantified and ambitious goal on climate finance before 2025.  

"In closing, Mr. President, the decisions we make at COP 26 must do justice to those "
"affected now, the future generations and the Mother Nature. The future of our planet "
depends on what we decide at this conference. 

I totally agree with Prime Minister Boris Johnson that this is the last change to sav e 
the earth.   

I thank you.

Excellencies. 
Distinguished guests. 
Delegates. 
Fellow  small  island  developing  states  and  especially  Niue’s Pacific 
family…a warm fakalofa lahi atu to you all. 
 
"It is my distinct privilege to convey this message to you all, on behalf of "
"my Premier, the Honourable Dalton Tagelagi and the people of Niue. "
 
"Niue extends its gratitude to the United Kingdom, to the city of Glasgow "
"and  its welcoming  people. To  the  Rt  Hon  Alok  Sharma, President of "
"COP26, we commend  you  and  your  team  on  the  enormous  effort  in "
hosting this conference and we commit our full support for a successful 
outcome. 
 
Mr President. 
 
"19 years ago, Niue’s premier addressed the World Summit on Sustainable "
Development. He said “history and our children would judge us” and at 
"COP26 my friends, the message is the same- “History and our children "
will  judge  us” - as  a  global  family  we  should  have  made  much  more 
"progress by now, so that no country should have to come to another COP "
and say that line again. 
For decades we have heard promises of ambition and yet time after time 
"there is no action, only targets and failed promises. "
"We must achieve success here, not just for us but for our children and "
their children. 
 
 
 
 


1
Mr President. 
 
This covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis has seen the 
world take bold action in dealing with it. 
Central banks mobilised trillions of dollars to combat the crisis. 
Covid-19 vaccines were produced in record time. 
"Let us now apply that bold, decisive action to fighting climate change. "
 
Mr President. 
 
"In Paris in 2015, we all agreed to pursue efforts to limit the rise in global "
warming to less than 1.5 degrees celcius. 1.5 (HAND SIGNAL 1.5). 
"Unfortunately, the recent IPCC report shows that we are failing, we are "
heading for 2.7 degrees. 
The UN Secretary General said the report was nothing less than a “code 
red for humanity”. A Code Red! 
COP26 must finalise the Paris Agreement. 
 
Mr President. 
 
"In recent years, Niue has experienced an increase in both frequency and "
severity of tropical cyclones. We have suffered huge economic and non-
economic loss. 
"To mitigate  for these  threats, vulnerable  infrastructure  has  had  to  be "
relocated at great cost. 
"Loss and damage must be addressed using not just insurance facilities, "
"with  exorbitant  premiums  we  cannot afford,  but  other  creative  financial "
instruments. 
 
Mr President. 
 
Niue’s  carbon  emissions  are  almost  zero and  yet  we  have  made  bold 
commitments in our Nationally Determined Contributions. 
"Currently, solar energy provides 38% of our national power grid and our "
target is 80% by 2025. 
What  we  do  is tiny  in  the  global  scheme.  What we  need  is a bolder 
commitment to reducing emissions by the world’s largest polluters. 
Niue  calls  upon  the G20  nations and big  business  for  greater 
commitments in their NDCs to meet the necessary ambition and to keep 
1.5 alive. 
Fossil fuel subsidies must be phased out and redirected to adaptation and 
mitigation efforts. 
 

2
Mr President. 
 
Many of us have faced significant challenges in accessing climate finance 
for our National Adaptation Plans (NAPs). 
The  process  needs  to  be  simpler  and quicker to  ensure  climate 
programmes are not scuttled before they get off the ground. 
We call on you to support the pathways that work for developing countries 
and invest in sustainable finance mechanisms that take into consideration 
our absorptive capacity and will build our capability incrementally. 
We need a clear path forward to operationalize the Global Goal on 
Adaptation (GGA). A path that is sufficiently flexible to reflect the unique 
"contexts of individual LDCs and SIDS, that supports locally appropriate "
implementation and does not increase the reporting burden. 
This clear roadmap for the GGA needs to be set as an outcome for 
COP26. 
 
Mr President. 
 
Niue shares the Blue Ocean Continent. Our ocean is a vital heirloom that 
connects us to our ancestors and a precious legacy we wish to hand to 
our future generations.  
"To this  end,  Niue has made  a  large contribution to the Ocean  Climate "
Nexus. 
"We have designated 40% (127000 sq km) of our sovereign waters, as a "
"Marine Protected Area, the global ask is 30%.  "
"This has mitigation, adaptation, and resilience benefits for Niue and will "
be reflected in our updated NDCs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3
 
Mr President. 
 
"COP26  cannot  be  remembered  as  just  another  COP,  it  must  be "
remembered as the COP that put humanity back on track towards keeping 
the 1.5 degree target alive. 
 
"In  the  end, you  are  free  to  choose  but  we all are not  free  from  the "
consequences of your choices. 
 
Thank you for listening. 
 
Kia monuina.

  Address by H.E. Malik Amin Aslam Khan  
                             
            Federal Minister - Climate Change  
            (Special Assistant to Prime Minister) 
                             
 26th Session of Conference of Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations 
           Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  
              (31-12 November 2021 Glasgow UK) 
 
  
"Excellency Mr Alok Sharma , President of COP 26 "
Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. 
 
"Mr President,  "
 
Let me take this opportunity to thank the Government and people 
of United Kingdom for successfully hosting the conference in the 
beautiful city of Glasgow.  
 
The  ongoing  COVID  crisis  has  taught  us  two  very  important 
lessons.  
 
Firstly – that we can not fight nature and hope to win. The COVID 
"pandemic,  biodiversity  crisis  and  the  climate  calamity  are  all "
manifestations of a losing battle.  

1
 
 
Nature knows how to rebalance and it will.  
 
It is us who need to step back from this warpath. 
 
Secondly – the COVID crisis has shown us that a better world is 
"out there and possible. This is the world that the youth, out on the "
"streets, is crying out for. This is the future that all of us in here need "
to be fighting for.  
 
It is a decarbonized and a nature positive world. 
 
"Excellency, "
 
"Under  the  visionary  green  leadership  of  our  PM  Imran  Khan, "
Pakistan has taken the choice to embrace this new world – shifting 
to clean energy and making nature an ally rather than an adversary 
of development. 
 
Our climate vision is built on these two pillars - shifting 60% of our 
energy mix towards clean energy by 2030 and 30% of our transport 
on EV by 2030 and of putting our trust and investment in “Nature 
Based Solutions”. We have announced to completely shift out of 
imported  coal  projects  and  are  turning  the  CPEC  into  a  China 

2
 
Pakistan Green Economic Corridor. Three financially closed coal 
projects of 2500 MW have been shelved in the last year and shifted 
to zero carbon Hydro power of 3700 MW.  
 
Pakistan’s “Ten Billion Tree Tsunami” has now become a global 
brand  for  successful ecosystem  restoration through  natural 
regeneration and forest plantations - all sequestering carbon for the 
world. 
 
"The  Protected  Areas  Initiative  in  Pakistan,  with  15  new  NPs "
"announced  during  the  COVID  time,  is  rapidly  expanding  and "
protecting our wilderness areas  
 
Our “Recharge Pakistan” initiative is turning the crisis of floods into 
an opportunity by using it to restore our wetlands and recharge our 
ground water aquifers. 
 
All these are examples of real climate action today – not an illusion 
"of climate action - and are now part of our updated NDC, which "
remains one of the most ambitious jumps for climate action in the 
world.  
 


3
 
We have dropped our emissions 9% below BAU in 2020 and have 
developed a pathway to reach 15% below BAU by 2030 utilizing 
our own resources – I repeat our own resources.  
 
"However, we have also thrown a conditional challenge to the world. "
Deliver us the climate finance of a $100 bn over the next decade 
and we will drop our emissions to 50% below BAU. 
 
"With less than 1% of the global emissions, Pakistan is certainly not "
"a part of the problem of climate change. However, we have chosen "
to be a part of the solution. Our NDC shows what is possible if a 
clear climate vision and strategic planning get positively aligned. 
The  World  Bank recently affirmed that  44%  of  our  mainstream 
development finance is on a climate friendly pathway and it is the 
highest for any country in the world. 
 
We are not just talking - but walking the talk on climate change.  
 
Can  this  room  also  walk  the  talk  on  climate finance – currently 
overpromised and under delivered?  
 
The decade  old  promissory  note  of  a $100  billion needs  to  be 
"delivered and, more importantly, 60% of it directed towards climate "
adaptation.  

4
 
 
Excellency 
 
"Even though we are not a major contributor, we continue to be on "
the top ten list of most vulnerable countries for 10 straight years 
now – this puts us in a special category of “continuously impacted 
"countries”. We are on the front lines - braving disastrous floods, "
unlivable heatwaves and bursting glaciers. 
 
"This  climate  injustice,  as  viewed  from  Pakistan’s  lens, is the "
gravest human  rights violation  of  history  where the  lives  and 
livelihoods of billions of people are at risk – all due to the unbridled 
pollution and uncontrolled excesses of a few. 
 
The forced climate adaptation needs remain at between $7 to $14 
billion  per  annum and  almost  70%  of  these  fall  in  the  loss  and 
damage category. This Adaptation finance is forced upon us today 
and presents a simple choice - between life and death. 
 
"Mr President,  "
 
"The  galaxy  of  world leaders  who  gathered  here  last  week, "
unfortunately failed to live up to the expectations of the world and 
rise to the reality of the grave challenge we face.  

5
 
 
Climate Change can not be wished away by throwing pennies into 
the Trevi fountain nor by announcing net zero scams pushing into 
2070
 
Climate  change  is  about  action  today and  can  no  longer  afford 
futuristic IOUs. 
 
This has to be the decisive decade for de-carbonization and nature 
positive development.   
 
The silver linings of this process are not found in this room but on 
the sidelines – the Pavilion Zone - where  the  private  sector 
"initiatives are gaining ground, the technologies becoming available "
and affordable and some new innovative financial mechanisms like 
the  “Energy  Transition  Mechanism”  and  “Nature  Performance 
Bonds” pushing new frontiers. Pakistan is actively engaged with all 
this “out of the box” thinking and this is really what gives hope that 
a new world is possible.  
 
"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
 
It is now time 
 

6
 
It is time to stop playing jokes with Climate Change. We will most 
certainly not have the last laugh on this.  
 
It is  time  to  change  course  so  let  us make  that  happen  here  at 
Glasgow. 
 
Let us not become the dinosaurs who refused to change. 
 
I thank you.

"Statement by His Excellency Surangel S. Whipps, Jr. "
President of the Republic of Palau 
"World Leaders Summit, COP 26 "
1-Nov-21
 
"         Alii  and  greetings  Prime  Minister  Boris  Johnson, "

"Excellencies,  Ladies  and  Gentlemen. Prime  Minister, thank  you  for "

"holding this      high-level platform, and allowing us  to set the stage for "

COP26.  

    The latest IPCC report indicates that our collective action to date is 

"not closing the “emissions gap,” and we are veering off the path of 1.5 "

degree warming limit. 

    The Palauan legend of Uab illustrates our state of emergency. Uab 

was a boy who grew into a giant that wouldn’t stop growing.  Due to his 

"unruly  appetite, the  whole island  community was forced to  feed  him. "

"Uab’s feeding depleted their natural resources, and finally, he threatened "

"to eat the people.  To save themselves, the villagers took bold action and "

"set fire to him. This is eerily reminiscent of today’s world, as the large "

emitters with their insatiable appetite for advancement are continuing to 

abuse our environment threatening our very survival.  COP 26 must light 

the fire. 


 
 

     

"     Excellencies, we must hold each other accountable. It is incumbent "

"on the  Parties  to  this Convention to concentrate on Radical  Action, "

"Consistent Mobilization, and Intentional Outcomes!  "

"    As such, Palau expects the set of rules guiding the implementation "

of the Paris Agreement be finalized as a priority outcome of COP26. 

"    For  Pacific  SIDS,  the  ocean-climate-biodiversity  nexus  demands "

"accountability  for  NDC  commitments,  realistic  timeframes,  and to "

begin bold action by cutting in half our emissions by 2030 to achieve 

net zero carbon by 2050.   

     As protectorates of the world’s largest ocean and carbon sink with 

"the establishment of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary in 2015, we "

"urge for the formal integration of the ocean into the UNFCCC process, "

through the Global Stock Take as a fundamental priority outcome of 

COP26.    

"    Prime Minister, the Convention must establish equitable access "

to  climate  financing  and  viable  technological  transfer  for  BOTH 

"mitigation  and  adaptation. We, the  islands  that  are  devastated  most, "

 
 

demand that your commitments of $100 billion annually be increased to 

"meet  the  $4  Trillion dollars the  World  Bank  reports  is  needed, with "

substantial shares of climate financing to support costly adaptation needs. 

"    Ladies and Gentlemen, Palau has a long and varied colonial past – "

our contacts with westerners began with our chief Ibedul discovering the 

Antelope commandeered by Captain Henry Wilson of England in 1783.  

"We were then colonized by Spain, Germany, Japan, and last by the US.  "

"Finally, in 1994 we regained our independence and sovereignty over our "

"lands and seas. However today, we are once again being invaded by the "

most powerful nations on earth by the results of their unbridled 

"emissions, exploiting us for their benefit and our detriment. How long "

must we suffer under colonization? 

    The scorching sun is giving us intolerable heat. The warming sea is 

invading us. The strong winds are blowing us every which way. Our 

"resources are disappearing before our eyes, our future is being robbed "

"from us. Frankly speaking, there is no dignity to a slow and painful "


 
 

death. You might as well bomb our islands instead of making us suffer 

only to witness our slow and fateful demise.  

"    Leaders of the G20, we are drowning and our only hope is the life "

ring you are holding. You must act now!  We MUST act together as we 

"say in our Palauan Chant “E ma demalasoi iang, Al eru bekelled eng "

"mekngit, ea de tal bekall e, eng ungil diak de kollii iang.”  It says when "

"traveling in one canoe, discord among the sailors will capsize the boat.  "

This chant reminds us that we need to deliver on our commitments and 

move in unison toward 1.5 to stay alive.  We owe this to each other and 

we owe it to our children!  

Thank you and Kom kmal mesulang.

"Mr. President, Excellencies and Distinguished Delegates "
 
It is my distinct honor and privilege to join colleague world leaders at this 
historic Global Summit. 
 
"At  the  outset, I  extend  my  sincere  appreciation  to  Prime  Minister  Boris "
Johnson for hosting this World Environment Leaders’ Summit. I also express 
"the  same  to  Hon.  Nicola  Sturgeon,  First  Minister  and  the  people  and "
Government  of  Scotland  for  the  excellent  arrangements  and  warm 
hospitality  accorded  to  me  and  my  delegation  since  our  arrival  in  the 
beautiful city of Glasgow. 
  
"I also acknowledge the incoming COP26 President, H.E. Mr. Alok Sharma "
as  well  as  the  Italian  Government’s  support  in  hosting  the  series  of 
preparatory events as co-host of this Summit. I also thank the Government 
of Chile as the outgoing President for their invaluable contributions.  
 
"Mr. President, "
 
We  meet  at  a  very  critical  period  where  climate  change  continues 
"unabated causing the atmosphere, oceans and the land to warm up at a "
faster  rate  than  ever  before.  This  is  detrimental  to  the  environmental 
"equilibrium of the global community, particularly for those of us from small "
island states.  
 
2
 
Papua  New  Guinea  is  not  immune  from  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate 
"change, rising sea levels and extreme erratic weather patterns that have "
devastated the livelihoods of the people and ecosystems that sustain their 
lives. 
 
"The  lower-income  and  marginalized  populations,  have  been  worst  hit  in "
their weak capacity to adapt has been telling. This has now been further 
"compounded  by  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  has  laid "
bare the structural weaknesses inherent in these populations. 
 
The COP26 Goals are explicit and I join colleague Leader’s in collectively 
calling for a ramp up and an acceleration of ambitions to: 
 
• Secure global net zero by mid-century and keep 1.5 degrees within  
    reach;  
• Adapt to protect communities and natural habitats;  
• Mobilize finance; and  
• Work together to deliver. 
 
"Mr.  President, "
 
"In  this  context,  I  reiterate  my  strong  position  at  the  recently  concluded "
76th  United  Nations  General  Assembly  session  an  impassioned  plea  for 
major  carbon  emitters  to  own  up  and  acknowledge  the  impact  of  high 
carbon  emissions  to  Small  Island  States  including  victims  of  climate 
change. 
 
We must take actions commensurate to the volume of emissions. Leaders 
of  big  carbon  emitting  nations  must  now  lead  the  global  effort  in 
"rebalancing  the  environmental  equilibrium.  We  live  in  one  planet,  one "
"atmospheric envelope, and one interlinked environmental system. Hence "
"as one humanity, we must rise and unite to preserve our planet. "
  
"We must commit to the energy targets, deal with land use, and advocate "
for  the  preservation  for  biodiversity  and  be  bold in  financing 
commitments. These issues are important to Papua New Guinea and the 
Pacific  Island  Forum  members  hence  we  seek  support  for  our  domestic 
and regional efforts towards mitigation and adaptation. 
 
I  want  to  specifically  request  the  Green  Climate Fund  (GCF)  to  consider 
developing a special set of criteria to enable us to qualify and successfully 
draw-down financial support. The level of funding that many Small Island 
"States  receive  from  GCF  is  still  insignificant.  Therefore,  I  will  meet  the "
Executive Director of GCF separately on the margins of COP26 to discuss 
and progress this matter.

"Mr. President,  "
 
"There  is  great  need  for  all  of  us  to  act  promptly,  responsibly  and "
collectively to redefine our policies and actions to ensure that we live in a 
"safe, secure and resilient environment. There is a need to make a call for "
all  of  us  to  ramp  up  on  our  commitments  to  support  taking  drastic  and 
specific  actions.  There  is  a  call to  ensure  that  our  national  commitments 
are  clearly  announced  and  that  important  timelines  are  clarified  and 
locked in.   
 
"Mr.  President, "
 
We  must  move  forward  to  conclude  key  elements  of the  Paris  Rulebook 
and  give  due  consideration  for  the  conservation  of  our  global  rainforest 
"and oceans. In our view, the Rule Book must not be complex and difficult, "
but user-friendly to easily access support needed to deliver mitigation and 
adaptation actions nationally and globally.  
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"To complement global efforts and operationalize the Paris Rule Book, I am "
pleased  to  inform  that Papua  New  Guinea  has  embarked  on  various 
initiatives  including  submission  of  our  Enhanced  Nationally  Determined 
Contributions (ENDC) to the UNFCCC Secretariat in 2020 outlining our goal 
to be carbon neutral by 2050. 
  
"Recently we launched the NDC Implementation Plan 2021-2030, the NDC "
Regulation  and  the  Roadmap  that  captures  the  detailed  information  of 
each  target  in  the  Enhanced  NDC.  This  demonstrates  my  country’s 
commitment to proactively combat climate change domestically. 
 
"In  addition,  my  Government  has  passed  Amendments  to  the  Climate "
Change Management Act to guide and strengthen our domestic climate 
change actions. 
 
"In forestry, we have ceased issuance of new timber permits and will ban "
export  of  round  logs  by  2025.  This  will  be  in  tandem  with  the recently 
launched NDC Roadmap for the Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use 
(AFOLU) and Energy Sectors aimed at achieving the pathway to achieve 
zero-net emissions target by 2050.  
 
"To strengthen our commitment to forest conservation and management, "
Papua  New  Guinea  and  the  International  Council  for  Research  in 
4
 
Agroforestry  (ICRAF)  will  formalize  a  Host  Agreement  to  develop 
agroforestry domestically on the margins of this meeting.  
"More  importantly,  in  our  ongoing  resolve  to  promote  alternative  clean "
"energy  sources,  I  am  pleased  to  inform  that  I  will  be  signing  a  Master "
Development  Agreement  with  Dr.  Andrew  Forrest  of  Fortesque  Futures 
Industries on the margins of this Summit. This signifies our efforts to transition 
from fossil fuels to clean energy by 2030.  
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"In  terms  of  our  reporting  obligations  under  the  Paris  Agreement,  Papua "
New  Guinea  has  made  serious  commitment  through  submitting  its  first 
Biennial Updated Report (BUR1) and its REDD Plus Annex in 2019 which are 
milestone achievements.  
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"In this spirit, we must all remain true to our words and take real practical "
actions  to  achieve  the  goals  of  the  UNFCCC  and  its  Paris  Agreement  in 
order to address the global threat facing humanity. 
 
Thank you and God Bless You All

      THE PHILIPPINES NATIONAL STATEMENT FOR THE COP 26 MEETING 
                                
                       Carlos G. Dominguez 
                       Secretary of Finance 
"            Chairman-Designate, Climate Change Commission "
"                        November 9, 2021 "
                                
The Philippines is determined to be a world leader in this fight against climate change.  
 
We account only for three-tenths of one percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. 
"Yet, we bear the brunt of the consequences of climate change. Our country is sinking "
"at a rate four times faster than the global average. Annually, we are confronted with "
"increasingly  severe  typhoons,  floods,  and  droughts.  Millions  of  lives  are  at  stake. "
"Clearly, climate change is very real to the Philippines. "
 
"To challenge ourselves and the rest of the world, we set the boldest national goal put "
"forward  by  any  country.  Under  President  Rodrigo  Duterte’s  administration,  the "
Philippines commits to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 75 percent in 2030.   
 
We are moving ahead with urgency to fulfill our ambitious target. We shifted from 
theorizing  about  climate  change  to  executing  practical  climate  adaptation  and 
mitigation projects on the ground. We have put together a group of Filipino experts 
who represent all corners of the Philippines to engage our fishermen and farmers and 
prepare them to execute localized action plans.  
 
We just launched our Sustainable Finance Roadmap to deploy the engines of finance 
to get green projects moving across our archipelago. To urge the Filipino people to 
"do their part on a daily basis in saving the world’s environment, we are pushing for a "
law  banning  single-use  plastics.  We  launched  a  partnership  with  the  Asian 
Development Bank for a landmark project that will accelerate our transition from coal 
to clean energy. This comes after President Duterte declared a moratorium on new 
coal plants a year ago. 
 
These  are  concrete  actions  to  demonstrate  to  the  world  how  a  developing  and 
climate-vulnerable  country  like  the  Philippines  can  lead  in  this  fight  to  save  our 
planet. This also shows that our commitments are not merely empty or half-baked 
"promises, but are supported by actionable projects on the ground.   "
 
FINAL 

We have very high expectations for this COP 26 to become not just merely an annual 
platform for discussion but a catalyst for concrete action plans.  
 
It’s  time  that  we  do  some  actual  work  on  the  ground  and  build  a  framework  for 
climate  justice.  Those  who  have  polluted  and  continue  to  pollute  the  Earth's 
environment through unthinking industrialization starting 200 years ago must pay for 
"the grants, investments, and subsidies needed for the most vulnerable countries to "
adapt to climate change. 
 
The time for debate is over. This is the time to finally begin acting on the fulfillment 
of our commitments and obligations to humanity.

     NATIONAL STATEMENT 
      World Leaders’ Summit 
           
  By the Rt. Hon. Prime Minister 
       Dr. Edouard Ngirente  
                 
  At the 26th Conference of the 
   Parties to the United Nations

"▪ Right    Honourable,    Prime "
"  Minister Boris Johnson, "
"▪ Excellencies, Heads of State and "
"  Government, "
▪ United    Nations    Secretary 
"  General, "
"▪ Distinguished Delegates, "
 
1. It  is  my  great  pleasure  to 
"  represent  His  Excellency,  Paul "
"  Kagame,    President  of   the "
"  Republic of Rwanda, at COP26.  "
 
2. I  would  like  to express  my 
  appreciation  to  the   United 
  Kingdom    for  hosting   this 
"  summit, and to the Government "
  and  people of  Scotland  for your 
  warm hospitality. 
 
2
       
3. We are falling short of our duty 
  to both people and the planet if 
  we   don’t  urgently   address 
  climate change.  
   
4. To cut temperatures  to below 
"  1.5 degrees, a 45% reduction of "
  emissions is required. This calls 
"  for immediate,  rapid,  and  large-"
  scale  reductions  in  greenhouse 
  gas emissions. 

 
"Excellencies, "
  
"5. In  Rwanda,  we  have  seen  first-"
  hand  the  impact  of  climate 
"  change.  Floods,  droughts  and "
  landslides   have     damaged 
3
       
"  livelihoods  and property, and "
"  tragically, cost too many lives.  "
   
6. That  is   why   Rwanda    is 
  committed      to     reducing 
  emissions  by  38%  in  the  next 
"  decade,  and  reach  Net  Zero  by "
2050
   
7. Rwanda   looks   forward   to 
  working with partner states and 
"  institutions, to  ensure   our "
  mitigation and adaptation plans 
"  can  be effectively implemented, "
  and make impactful contribution 
  to global efforts. 
  
4
       
8. I take this opportunity to thank 
  every country that  has  ratified 
  the  Kigali  Amendment  to  the 
"  Montreal     Protocol,     and "
  encourage  all  remaining parties 
"  to  do  so.  If  implemented  fully, "
  the Amendment  could  avoid  up 
  to  0.4   degrees  Celsius  of 
  warming  by  the  end  of  the 
  century.  

  
9. It  is also time  for  us  to  come 
  together to realize the potential 
  of the Paris Agreement. 
   
"10. Let us keep 1.5 alive, scale up "
"  timely  and  ambitious  actions, "
"  mobilize  finance, and  complete "
5
       
  the Paris Rulebook so that there 
  are  no  more  delays  to  climate 
  action. 
   
11. Rwanda pledges its full support 
  for  inclusive  and  transparent 
"  negotiations,     and      for "
  collaboration  and    dialogue 
  between  partners  around  the 
  world.  

       
    I thank you. 
      National Statement by Hon Eric Evelyn 
    Minister of Environment and Co-operatives 
              St Kitts and Nevis 
"          Tuesday November 9, 2021 "
"          COP26 Glasgow, Scotland "
 
"Presidents,  Prime  Ministers,  Excellencies,  Delegates, "
"Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, "
 
"Today, the delegation of  St  Kitts  Nevis comes with  one "

simple message – the time for action is NOW!  We are here 

at a time when the entire World is languishing from the 

"horrors of climate change including sea level rise, extreme "

"weather events, and dramatic changes in rainfall patterns.  "

We are here at a time when coastal towns and villages and 

even entire islands face destruction; at a time when lives 

"and livelihoods are at stake, all undoubtedly attributed to "

"human interference.  Yet, enough action is not being taken "
to  remedy  this  situation  that  worsens with  every  second 

that the clock ticks. 

We are at a crossroad where the science is explicit; that to 

contain climate change to an acceptable level we must limit 

global  temperature  increase  to  1.5°C.  The  latest  IPCC 

report indicates that we still have a chance but must act now 

in order to reach net zero emissions by mid-century.  

Climate change is real and St. Kitts and Nevis has launched 

during  COP26 a  more significantly ambitious Revised 

Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) proposing to 

reduce emissions  by  61%  by  2030  compared  to  2010 

levels. 
Our revised NDC is an example of the leadership displayed 

by most  vulnerable  countries in  particular  us  in  the 

Caribbean  and  other SIDS  and  LDCs as  we  continue  to 

demonstrate leadership despite only being responsible for 

7% of global Green House Gas emissions.  We suffer the 

most from a problem that we did not create.  Yet we are 

deprived  of  much  needed  climate  finance for  loss  and 

"damage,  mitigation  and  adaptation  efforts.  This,  Mr. "

President is unacceptable and it has to change.  

St Kitts and Nevis will heavily invest in renewable energy 

with plans for a 35 Megawatt solar farm to be operational 

in  two  years  and we continue  to aggressively  pursue 

geothermal power.  
Climate  friendly  policies will  enable  us  to advance 

initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint.  Our efforts have 

been complemented by the friendship of the Republic of 

China (Taiwan).   

Taiwan  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  the  climate 

dilemma  by  enacting  appropriate  legislation  and 

announcing an  ambitious  NDC  including  achieving  net 

"zero  emissions  by  2050.  Mr.  President,  with  such "

"exceptional efforts, Taiwan deserves a seat at the table and "

I humbly ask that Taiwan be admitted to the Convention. 

"Mr. President, the gap between where we are heading and "

where we need to be is far too large and we absolutely must 

have an outcome that fits the scale of this climate crisis. 
Let us stand on the right side of history. We cannot wait 

"another day, week, month, or year, we need action NOW.  "

The World is a global village and the decisions you make 

in  the  United  States  affect  us  in  the  Caribbean;  the 

"decisions that you make in China,, Canada and the United "

Kingdom affect the little girl and boy in the Pacific.  

The  World  is  depending  on us  at  COP26  so  let us not 

disappoint.  I  implore  us all to solemnly  pledge  to  save 

ourselves from extinction.   

As  I  close  I am obligated  to  remind us all that  the 

environment  and  Planet  Earth  need  champions.  I  am 

committed  to  be  one  and  so  is  my  country  St  Kitts  and 

"Nevis.  I leave you with this question, Are you prepared to "

be one?

   3-Minute National Statement by Honourable Philip Joseph Pierre 
                Prime Minister of SAINT LUCIA 
                              
"Mr.  President, I  join in  commending  you  for hosting this  momentous "
"convergence  of world  leaders,  to  set  the  stage  for  the  United  Nations "
Climate  Change  conference  this  year.  As  we  grapple  with  the global 
"pandemic, I believe our presence here is testimony to our recognition that "
we are at a critical juncture; a tipping point.  
"This is the last decade, 2020-2030 - the last chance to set the world on "
"track to 1.5 degrees. The question is, will we rise to the challenge? Will our "
"moral conscience prevail? Small Island Developing States as my country, "
"Saint Lucia, whose special circumstances and needs were settled in Paris, "
are in the midst of crisis for humanity. 
The UN Secretary General described the IPCC Working Group 1 Report as 
"“a code red for humanity.”  Undeniably, certain changes, such as sea level "
"rise and ocean acidificaton are already locked in, with dire consequences "
for SIDS and low lying states.  But we know that 1.5 degrees Celsius is still 
"within our reach.  To achieve it, we must act, and act now!  "
Countries must urgently  bring forward new  NDCs  with  2030  targets 
"consistent with the 1.5-degree temperature goal, supported by credible "
"net zero-by-2050 long-term strategies.   We must support wind, solar and "
other renewable energy investments. 
The power to turn things around lies in our collective hands. We must be 
focused and resolute.  We cannot vacillate on matters of human survival.   
 

1
 
"In this regard, world leaders must deliver on the long-term climate finance "
"goal  that  was  promised,  supporting,  not  only mitigation,  but  also "
"adaptation.  We must also raise the profile of, and mainstream loss and "
damage as a distinct pillar of climate action and support. 
 
"Moreover, it is high time that we complete the Paris Rulebook.  When we "
"bring to fru-i-tion that vital work, we can strengthen accountability and "
"enable  the highest possible  ambition,  while  ensuring  transparency  and "
environmental integrity. 
 
"Colleagues, friends, we, in the developing world, are on the front lines, "
exposed.  Our poor vulnerable citizens have limited ability to respond to 
"climate  change  effects  and  so,  their  quality  of  life  is significantly "
diminished. 
 
"As responsible leaders, can we, in good conscience, sacrifice humanity for "
industry?  Will we continue to ignore the science to gamble with the future 
"of our youth, women, indigenous communities, private sector and NGOs?   "
"What are the prospects for nations like Taiwan, yet to be recognised by the "
"UN  as  a  bona  fide  state,  but also  confronting climate  change, while "
supporting SIDS?  
 
"The young people who will inherit this planet, are watching us.  We cannot "
fail them.  Let us not be that generation of leaders who had the last chance 
"to set the world on track, but chose not to put people first.  "
 
I thank you.

1
           
1. Mr. President. 
   
2. Excellencies and distinguished colleagues. 
           
3. This past year has been the most challenging period in St. Vincent and 
  the Grenadines’post-colonial history. We continue to grapple with the 
"  challenges precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic,  the devastation "
"  caused  by  the explosive eruption  of  the  La  Soufriere  Volcano, and "
  severe floods  and  landslides  due  to  more  extreme  weather 
  phenomena. These challenges underscore our intrinsic vulnerabilities 
  and threaten our very existence. 
   
"4. Mr.  President,  the  most  pertinent  questions for  our  people are  the "
  following:  
   
     - How  long  will  aspirational  declarations  and  diplomatic 
       maneuvering delay the concrete actions required to ensure our 
       planet remains below the 1.5 degree target? 
           
     - Will  developed countries acknowledge that insufficient funding 
       for adaptation measures results in catastrophic loss and damage 
       to  SIDS? 
        
"     - Will G20  countries,  responsible  for  nearly  80%  of  carbon "
"       emissions, honour their commitment to develop and implement "
       ambitious NDCs to reduce global emissions? 
           
2
 
  5. St. Vincent and the Grenadines therefore calls for URGENT action to 
    avert this climate crisis. 
     
  6. The UNFCCC Synthesis Report clearly indicates that current NDCs 
    are woefully inadequate. 
     
  7. They will NOT bridge the gap between existing commitments and the 
    1.5  pathway. 
     
  8. We MUST accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in 
"    this DECISIVE DECADE, to achieve net zero by 2050. "
     
  9. Failure  to  take  the  necessary  steps  to  address  this climate  crisis  is 
    reckless and endangers the 72 million people living in Small Island 
    Developing States. 
     
10. To compromise on the required targets and measures is a death 
    sentence for our people! 
     
11. Negotiating your way out of this responsibility is not an option! 
     
"12. Mr. President, my country continues to do its part both nationally, and "
    internationally  as  a  non-permanent member  of  the  UN  Security 
"    Council, in the global fight against climate change. "
     
"13. However, new and additional finance, technology transfer and capacity "
    building  support are required  to  ensure  we  can  fully  implement  the 
    Paris Agreement.  
     
3
 
14. We welcome the commitment of some developed countries to scale up 
    finance pledges and we urge others to deliver on the outstanding 100 
    billion per annum commitment. 
     
15. This fight requires the inclusive action and meaningful participation of 
    everyone. We commend  Taiwan’s efforts to legislate climate targets 
    and they should be at the table.  
     
"16. Finally, Mr President, COP 26 must be remembered as the Summit "
"    where  we  completed the  Paris  Rule  book, anything  less  will  be  a "
    failure! 
     
17. Climate change is the defining global challenge of our time.  
     
18. We cannot squander decades of hard work. The stakes are TOO high 
    and time is running out!  
     
Thank you.

     Ladies and Gentlemen 
      
     Climate change has long been an interwoven fabric of life for the 
Blue  Pacific  including Samoa over decades.  As  Small  Island  Developing 
"States (SIDS), we first told the world that our coastlines were eroding, the sea "
level was rising and climate change was human-induced. Many did not take our 
concerns  seriously;  some  wanted  scientific  evidence  while  others  remained  in 
"denial.  Now, the recent IPCC reports confirm all this and more. As humanity, there "
is no time for second guessing.  We need to act urgently and decisively with much 
"higher climate ambition, to correct our mistakes that led to the current climate "
crises.   
      
                             Page 1 of 4 

 
     We  acknowledge  efforts  by  all  parties  that  have  committed  to  ambitious 
"climate action.  However, it is concerning that there is still a wide emissions gap "
"in meeting the 1.5°C goal.  Even with limiting warming to 1.5°C, SIDS will continue "
to incur severe loss and damage.  Exceeding this will be catastrophic for us; hence 
"the constant iteration by the Blue Pacific Leaders, that climate change is the single "
greatest threat to our people and islands.  
      
     We recognize the double burden of addressing the parallel crises of climate 
"change and the pandemic, but we stand to lose a lot more if we remain in a state "
of inaction. The COVID-19 pandemic should not delay ambitious climate action.  
"Instead, sustainable economic recovery should be catalyzed through investments "
"that are clean, climate-smart and in line with net zero emissions by 2050.   "
      
     The development of COVID-19 vaccines was the fastest in history.  Its rollout 
around the world at large scale required a massive global coordinated effort.  I 
"often ponder on how we can push for this historical, united, urgent global response "
at the same massive scale to help us reach the 1.5 degrees Celsius promise of the 
"Paris Agreement. For us as the Blue Pacific, we need to inject some of that urgency "
"and ambitious actions, like what we achieved with the COVID19 vaccinations, to "
deliver the needed climate action.   
      
"     It is in Glasgow, that climate urgency enters the collective consciousness. "
"We must ensure through commitments and our decisions at COP26, that we keep "
the hope of a 1.5 degree world.  This is our point of no return. 
      
                             Page 2 of 4 

 
" But we as SIDS, know that despite our best efforts, the real impact to reverse the "
cycle of decline we are in; relies on the will and commitment of others. For this 
"reason, we will persist to call on everyone especially the major emitters, to commit "
to ambitious emissions cuts by 2030; implement commitments consistent with the 
1.5°C  scenario  and  net  zero  global  emissions  by  2050. Nature  based solutions 
should  take  precedence in  our  sustainable development efforts. Phasing  out  of 
coal plants and all fossil fuel subsidies and investments are critical.   

     We continue to stress the importance of the delivery of the US 100 billion 
goal to  ensuring  the  implementation  of  ambitious  mitigation  commitments. 
"However, funding for the root causes of climate change is exponentially greater "
than funding for the response to climate change.  This must change.   We need to 
ensure a new scaled up climate finance goal that builds on the USD100 billion 
floor.   We  must guarantee a  balanced  allocation  of  climate  finance  between 
mitigation  and  adaptation. Climate  finance  made  available  to  SIDS  are  still 
"insufficient and are mainly in the form of loans.  SIDS must receive scaled up, "
"adequate, predictable and long-term support from the international community to "
adapt.  Loss and damage needs dedicated funding. COP 26 must address the long-
term and permanent consequences of insufficient climate action. 

"     While we urge for COP 26 to conclude negotiations on the Paris Rulebook, it "
is important that it adopts a Markets mechanism which delivers meaningful global 
emissions reductions. We must ensure that we continue to uphold the principle of 
environmental  integrity and  keep the  Paris  Agreement  promise. This  is critical 
when finalising COP26 outcomes. 
 

                             Page 3 of 4 

 
"     Lastly but not the least, the Ocean absorbs nearly a quarter of annual carbon "
dioxide emissions and plays a central role in regulating the Earth’s climate. The 
"climate-ocean nexus is clear, thus oceans needs to feature more in the work of "
"the UNFCCC. This is an important priority for the Blue Pacific. Furthermore, slow "
and  onset  events  such  as  sea  level  rise  due  to  climate  change  threatens  the 
security of our maritime zones.  This is why the Pacific Leaders have endorsed the 
Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the face of Climate-Change Related 
Sea Level Rise. The Declaration states very clearly our region’s collective position 
and commitment to maintaining our maritime zones without reduction in the face 
of climate change related sea level rise. 

"     Excellencies, "

     Climate change is at the heart of our vulnerabilities as nations and peoples.  
"While we may be the worst affected, the real solution is not in our hands, "
"especially when it comes to global emission reductions.  However, through the "
"COP26 negotiations and the multilateral process, we hope to shape the solutions "
to save our planet.  There are no trade offs.  We are negotiating the survival of 
our islands.  
 
Thank you.

"Your Excellencies, "
"Ladies and gentlemen, "

"First of all, I’d like to thank the United Kingdom for "
welcoming us here in Glasgow and for hosting this climate 
"change conference, COP26. "

"Ladies and gentlemen, "

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia believes that we all have to 
renew our efforts to implement the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and 
"the Paris Agreement, and that we all should keep in mind the "
"principle of shared, yet distinct, responsibilities among "
different countries. 

"Equally, we should all be conscious of the special "
"circumstances of the Less Developed Countries, and we should "
work together to help these countries mitigate the impact of 
"climate change policies, without compromising their "
sustainable development. 

"In light of this, the Kingdom has recently launched the Saudi "
Green Initiative (SGI) and the Middle East Green Initiative 
"(MGI), which aim to reduce carbon emissions in the Middle "
East by more than 10% of the current global contributions. 

"Over the past decade, recognizing the increasing importance "
"of prioritizing our climate change ambitions, the Kingdom has "
"revised its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), "
pledging to reduce emissions by 278 million tons per year by 
"2030, more than double the previous goal set in 2015. "
"It has also announced its ambition to achieve net zero by 2060, "
"within the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) framework, and "
in line with the Kingdom’s developmental and diversification 
"plans, and the dynamic baseline of its NDC, providing that the "
necessary technologies for this approach are mature and 
available. 

This will help ensure that the Kingdom maintains and 
enhances its leadership role in promoting the security and 
stability of energy markets. 

"Furthermore, the Kingdom has announced its intention to join "
"the Global Methane Pledge, which aims at limiting methane "
emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. 

"To realize these ambitious plans, the details of more than 53 "
"Saudi initiatives have been published, with more than 185 "
billion dollars of investment. 

These initiatives include increasing the share of renewables 
"in the power mix to 50%, launching the Saudi Energy "
"Efficiency Program, establishing one of the largest hydrogen "
hubs in the world in NEOM as the Kingdom aspires to 
"produce 4 million tons of green and blue hydrogen annually, "
"and setting up the largest CCUS complex, with a capacity of "
44 million tons per year by 2030. 

"In addition, the Kingdom is establishing a 10 billion dollar "
"fund for deploying CCE technologies in the Middle East, "
Africa and developing countries. 

The Kingdom has also launched a global initiative to provide 
clean cooking solutions to more than 750 million people. 
The total investment in these two initiatives is around 11 
"billion dollars, of which the Kingdom will finance 15%. Saudi "
Arabia will work with different countries and regional and 
international funds to seek ways to finance and implement 
these initiatives. 

"In addition, the Kingdom announced as well a number of "
"regional and international initiatives, such as a regional center "
"for early warning of storms, and a regional center for "
sustainable development of fisheries.  

Both will play a crucial role in building the infrastructure 
"needed to protect the environment, reduce emissions and "
promote regional coordination. 

it has also launched one of the largest afforestation projects in 
the world for planting trees in the Kingdom and the Middle 
East to remove carbon. 

"Ladies and gentlemen, "

The fact that climate change is a universal phenomenon 
"requires an international, shared and effective response. "

That response should address three main pillars: energy 
"security, economic development for the benefit of humanity, "
and climate change. 

"All of these pillars must be addressed in a holistic manner, "
without compromising one for the sake of another. 

It is imperative that we recognize the diversity of climate 
"solutions, and the importance of emissions reduction as "
"stipulated in the Paris Agreement, without any bias towards or "
against any particular source of energy. 

I am grateful for your attention here today. I wish all of us 
success in achieving our noble and ambitious goals.

National  Statement     by  Mr.  Wavel   John  Charles    Ramkalawan 
President   of  the  Republic  of  Seychelles    on  the  occasion  of 
"COP26/CMP16/CMA3.0         – World  Leaders’  Summit  (WLS),  High-"
"Level Segment: 1-2 November 2021 Glasgow, UK. "
 
Mr President 
 
We are honoured to be here today and join those who have already spoken before in 
thanking The United Kingdom  of Great  Britain and  Northern  Ireland and the city  of 
Glasgow and its people for their warm hospitality and for the opportunity to address our 
generation’s most urgent crisis.  
 
"Our presence here today, despite the on-going COVID 19 pandemic, demonstrates how "
crucial climate change is on our Agenda. The lives that will be lost due to the adverse 
"effects of climate change if we do not act now, will be much worse than the pandemic. "
"Needless to say, our issues have been further compounded with the devastation of the "
COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
"Like  other  Small  Island  Developing  States, the  Republic  of  Seychelles recognises  that "
building  resilience  to  climate  change  and  committing  to a low-emission  development 
pathway provide a firm basis for continued growth and sustainable development. We 
view climate change as an increasingly dire emergency that challenges all aspects of our 
chances  for  future  survival  and undermines  Seychelles’  efforts  to  fully  achieve  the 
sustainable development goals. 

 
"Nonetheless,  Seychelles stands steadfast alongside  our  fellow  SIDS in  remaining "
"politically, morally, and  socially committed. Meaningful  progress on  climate  action  is "
"urgently required, as highlighted by the IPCC and WMO recently to put us on a path to a "
1.5°C future. 
 
"As small as our contributions are to the degradation of the planet, we are committed to "
further reducing them through our updated Nationally Determined Contribution or NDC 
because we feel it and we know it. Our issues have been further compounded by the 
devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
1
 
Mr. President 

The world must build a vision for a climate resilient future that puts adaptation and loss 
"and damage at the centre of decision-making, and take immediate action now to protect "
"people, the economy, and the environment. Seychelles acknowledges that adaptation "
"challenges  require  inclusive  and  sensitive  global action, and  we  share  a  collective "
"ambition, in line with the SDGs, to achieve a global society in which no person, no country "
is left behind. It is imperative that we step up our efforts to meet these urgent challenges.  

Mr. President 

"Seychelles, therefore, calls on industrialized countries to take the lead in stepping up and "
displaying the  leadership  they  claim  to  stake to  the  level  that  the  science  tells  us  is 
required to keep 1.5 alive! Clinging to coal and failing to help us all accelerate the clean 
energy transition while parading as climate champions is nothing but bad faith. 

We have in this COP the daunting task of concluding the Paris rulebook before we leave 
Glasgow. Countries need to rediscover the political courage they had in Paris in 2015 to 
complete the rulebook on time. We must build the vessels we need to carry us towards a 
low carbon and clean energy future. 

It is now up to us leaders to fill these vessels with increased ambition on climate action to 
close  the substantial  gap  between  the commitments countries  have  put  forward  to 
reduce  their  emissions  and  the  much  higher  level  of  ambition  needed  to  meet  the 
temperature limitation goals established in the Paris Agreement.   We must pick up the 
pace of the negotiations significantly if the Paris Agreement implementation rules are to 
be finalised at this COP. 

Mr. President 

Substantial progress also has to be made on the critical issue of ramping up financial and 
capacity-building  support to  SIDS like  Seychelles and  other  developing  countries to 
"accelerate the deployment of clean energy, nature-based and other climate solutions, "
and to better meet the worsening impacts of climate change; this must be a much higher 
priority going forward because the USD 100 billion per year in climate financing by 2020 
as pledged is long overdue. 


2
 
Mr. President 

The science clearly indicates that now is the time for all leaders  to  walk  the talk and 
immediately start implementing the Paris Agreement roadmap. The 2030 climate and 
"energy  package in  Seychelles’ NDC is, for  an  example, an opportunity for us to  show "
leadership in adopting more ambitious targets for renewables and energy efficiency in 
coherence with the Paris Agreement. It is an opportunity to prove that SIDS are prepared 
to lead by example by scaling up their ambition at home. 

Seychelles will protect at least 50% of our seagrass and mangrove ecosystems by 2025 
and 100% by 2030 as nature-based blue carbon ocean climate action. We also intend to 
regulate coastal planning and infrastructure at the national and local level to prioritize 
“blue” nature-based solutions.  
 
"As you can see, Mr President, ambitious ocean action is a key priority for my government "
as a SIDS and a big ocean state as we look to address the climate and biodiversity crises 
together wherever we can while enhancing our Blue Economy. 

Mr. President 

We once again urge all governments - with the major emitters taking the lead in cutting 
emissions  and  the  industrialised  countries in providing  the  promised  support  to 
developing  countries - to  continue  to  step  up  to  meet  the  ever-growing  challenge  of 
tackling climate change to the scale that the worsening crisis demands. 

"Allow me to say in closing, that the international community has shown in the way it "
tackled COVID-19 that it can act swiftly and decisively when it wants to. Climate change 
will  be  with  us  long  after  we  have  brought  the  pandemic  under  control  and  with  far 
greater consequences. 

"So I challenge the world, Mr President, to respond as we did to COVID-19 and take climate "
"action as if the futures of our countries and economies, and indeed our lives, depend on "
"it, because they do.  "

I thank you for your attention

"STATEMENT BY H.E. MS BARBARA CREECY, MINISTER OF FORESTRY, FISHERIES AND "
"THE ENVIRONMENT OF SOUTH AFRICA, HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT OF THE UN CLIMATE "
"CHANGE  CONFERENCE  (COP26/CMP16/CMA3),  GLASGOW,  UNITED  KINGDOM,  08 "
Nov-21
 
"Excellencies, "

 

"For  Africa,  as  a  region  that  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  climate "

"change, delayed climate action is not an option. We are facing the full "

"impacts of the climate emergency, even as we struggle to overcome "

the devastating socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic 

that has exacerbated Africa´s Special Needs and Circumstances.  

 

"Our sustainable  development  efforts have  been  set  back, and  our "

message  to  the  international  community  is  clear – we  need  your 

"support now more than ever before to achieve our climate objectives, "

in the context of a Just Transition. 

 

South  Africa  is  making  progress on  our  climate  goals:  we  have 

"established  the Presidential  Climate  Commission, adopted the "

"National Adaptation Strategy, implemented an enhanced Mitigation "

"system with robust monitoring and evaluation, and have developed a "

long-term low emissions strategy.  

 

1
 
We  have  submitted  our updated  and  significantly  more  ambitious 

NDC  ahead  of  COP 26.  This brings  forward  the  peaking  of  our 

emissions  by  a  decade  and  contains  detailed  information  on 

adaptation  and  the  support  we  require  from  the  international 

community.  

 

"True to the letter and spirit of the Paris Agreement, the lower end of "

our 2030  updated target  emission  range  is  consistent  with  a  1.5-

"degree pathway, while the upper end of the range is consistent with "

a 2-degree pathway. Where we get to in this range will depend on the 

international support we receive. 

 

Our country is developing detailed plans to enable a Just Transition 

to a low carbon economy and climate resilient society. These plans 

will locate support for affected workers and communities and will be 

at the centre of these plans.  

 

"Excellencies,  "

 

"To ensure that we have a balanced outcome at COP26, we need to "

send a clear signal that all three priorities of the Paris Agreement will 

be advanced with equal determination.  

2
 
 

"In this regard, we need a two-year work programme on the Global "

Goal on Adaptation under the CMA. This programme must address 

"the financing, economic  and  social  impacts  of  climate  change  on "

developing countries.  

 

"To re-establish trust, we need developed countries to honor current "

obligations to provide finance and technical support. We must also 

move with speed to activate the post-2025 Finance Goal because we 

on the African Continent know that if we are to sustain the notion that 

"COP26 is the “Ambition COP”, we need a clearly defined ambitious "

long-term finance goal.  

 

This week we must conclude Article 6. Environmental integrity and 

robust accounting need to be at the centre. South Africa supports a 

share  of  proceeds  as  a  source  of  predictable and  sustainable 

financing for adaptation action. 

 

"Finally, we look forward to working with all Parties to secure a fair deal "

for developing countries that not only enables us to meet our climate 

"goals and targets, but also allows us to do our fair share to keep the "

planet habitable for future generations.  

3
 
 

South  Africa is  playing  its  part to make COP26  a  successful 

conference. The world is watching all our actions and we must do our 

best to deliver on our peoples’ expectations. 

 

I thank you.

South  Sudan’s National Statement  by  Hon. 
"Josephine  Napwon    Cosmos,   Minister  of "
Environment  and  Forestry  of  the  Republic  of 
South Sudan at the Resumed High-Level Segment 
"of  COP26 on 9th  November 2021, Glasgow-UK "
 
 
Mr. President; 
Heads of Government; 
Hon. Ministers; 
Heads of Delegations; 
Distinguished Delegates; 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
 
It  is  with  great  honour  that  I convey  to  you  the 
greetings  and  well  wishes  of  H.E Gen. Salva  Kiir 
"Mayardit, President of  the  Republic  of  South  Sudan. "
Although  he  has  not  been  able  to  attend  in-person 
"due  to  some  pressing  issues,  he  is  keenly  following "
the  Conference  and  is  fully  committed  to the 
implementation of the COP26 resolutions. 
 
I would be remiss if I do not take this opportunity to 
"congratulate you, Mr.  President, on your election  as "
President of COP26 and wish you success during your 
tenure.   
 


1
"Mr. President, "
 
"As you are aware, South Sudan signed and ratified the "
"Paris Agreement since 2016; however, we are still in "
the process of developing the Paris Rule Book. As we 
"do so, the Climate crises is worsening globally and at "
"home. For a third year  in  a  row, nine out  of the  ten "
states in South Sudan are flooded. Subsequently over 
1.2  million people  have  lost  their  livelihoods or are 
living under dire conditions.  
 
"Additionally,  droughts,  excessive  heat, heat  waves, "
and irregular  rain  patterns  are  causing  crop  failure 
and  further destruction to  the already  dilapidated 
livelihoods of our people. 
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"As  a matter  of  fact,  it  is  indisputable  that South "
"Sudan's  emissions are  negligible; nevertheless,  we "
submitted  a  very ambitious Second  Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs)  and  our  First 
National Adaptation Plan (NAP) to the United Nations 
Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC).  
 
"As  we will all  agree,  the  implementation  of  these "
strategies  and  plans  will  only  be  realised  with  the 
provision  of  climate  finance  by  the developed 


2
countries.  Although the 100 billion USD pledged for 
"2020  was  not  met,  it  is  our  hope that  the  targeted "
"funding  will  be  met  by  2023.  But,  given  the "
magnitude  of  the catastrophes brought  forth  by 
"Climate Change,  we  believe  that  the  100 billion USD "
pledged  is  not  sufficient  to  address  these pressing 
"challenges. Therefore,  we implore  the  parties  to "
increase their contributions.  
 
South Sudan also recommends that 50% of the funds 
raised be earmarked for the adaptation projects and 
that the  funds  be  provided  as  grants  rather  than 
loans. 
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"On  the  emissions gap, we  appeal  to  all  parties  that "
have  not yet submitted  their Nationally  Determined 
"Contributions (NDCs) to do so immediately, so that all "
the parties are able to meet the 1.5 ̊ C goal. 
 
South  Sudan  commends  the  declaration  on 
deforestation  and  land  use  and  hopes  that  it  will 
access  funding to complement its  national  plan for 
planting 100 million trees in 10 years.  
 


3
"In  our  efforts  to  curb  deforestation, South  Sudan "
intends  to  generate  3000  megawatts  of power  from 
"hydro, solar, wind, geothermal and natural gas.  "
"In the area of agriculture and food production, South "
Sudan  plans  to  engage  the  agriculture  sector in 
introducing smart agriculture technology.  
 
"All  these  efforts,  as  you  know,  require  financial "
"support, capacity building and technology transfer.  "
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"In conclusion, to succeed in our fight against climate "
"change,  it  is the  responsibility  of the  big  emitters  to "
raise their ambitions and  drastically  cut  their 
emissions. It  is  only  in doing so that the world  will 
reverse the dangerous trend that we are taking. 
 
We  declare  to  all  the  parties  that South  Sudan  will 
play  its  utmost  role  in  ensuring  that  we  save  the 
planet and preserve it for the future generations.  
 
I thank you Mr. President.

This event takes place at a critical time for humanity. 

"As a developing tropical island nation with abundant biodiversity, Sri Lanka is deeply aware "

of the impacts of climate change.  

"Our rich philosophical heritage, shaped by Lord Buddha’s teachings, places great value on "

environmental integrity. 

Sustainability is therefore at the heart of our national policy framework.  

Sri Lanka’s updated Nationally Determined Contributions aims to reduce emissions towards 

achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  

"We have prioritised enhancing national forest cover, with initiatives underway to increase our "

carbon sequestration capacity by 7% by 2030. 

We will increase contribution of renewable energy sources to 70% of national energy needs 

by 2030 and are taking steps to phase out use of fossil fuels.  

Sri Lanka is also proud to be a co-lead of the “Global Energy Compact for No New Coal Power”.   

"Sri Lanka recently restricted imports of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and weedicides due to "

"public health concerns, water contamination, soil degradation, and biodiversity impacts. "

"Although opposed by entrenched lobbies, this has created opportunities for innovation and "

investment into organic agriculture that will be healthier and more sustainable in future. 

Reactive  nitrogen  emissions from overuse  of  artificial  fertilizer  is  a  major  contributor  to 

climate change.  

 
In  2019 Sri  Lanka spearheaded  the  Colombo  Declaration  on  Sustainable  Nitrogen 

"Management, which seeks to halve Nitrogen waste by 2030.   "

We look forward to more countries joining this initiative. 

Sri Lanka also leads the Action Group on Mangrove Ecosystems and Livelihoods under the 

Commonwealth Blue Charter initiative. 

"Sri Lanka welcomes investments, technology transfers, and climate financing for its ambitious "

"sustainability efforts, along with broader development assistance to support recovery from "

the COVID19 pandemic. 

"Climate change affects all nations, but disproportionately impacts developing island nations.  "

Developing nations that take bold steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation 

deserve extensive support. 

It  is  essential  that the world’s  largest  emitters of  greenhouse  gases fulfil  their national 

commitments and assist developing nations navigate through the climate crisis. 

I call upon all nations to work together in a spirit of true cooperation to overcome this crisis 

and sustain humanity and our planet. 

Thank you.  
"Mr. President, "
"Excellency’s, "
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
 
On behalf of the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan it is a great 
honor for me to address this gathering. 
 
"Tajikistan,  as  a mountainous landlocked  country, forms  about sixty "
"percent of the water resources of Central Asia, and is the main location of "
"regions’ glaciers, where the  bulk  of  the  region's  water  resources  are "
"formed, thus playing an  important  role  in  ensuring sustainable "
development in the entire Central Asian region. 
 
"We  over  the  recent years observe rapid  melting  of  glaciers,  dramatic "
"reduction of water resources, increase of mudflows and floods, droughts "
and other natural disasters induced by climate change. This situation has 
been causing a significant damage to our national economy and severely 
undermines our efforts towards achieving sustainable development.  
 
I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  reiterate the proposal of  the 
President  of  the Republic  of  Tajikistan to proclaim 2025  as  the 
International Year for Glaciers Preservation. 
 
Tajikistan  repeatedly appeals  international community  to  create  an 
"International  Fund  for  Glaciers  Preservation,  through  which  we  could "
mobilize efforts and resources for practical steps to preserve glaciers - the 
most important source of fresh water in Central Asia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
 
The  contribution  of  our  country in  terms  of GHG  emissions is  minimal. 
"Nevertheless, Tajikistan in  its updated  version  of  the Nationally "
Determined  Contribution undertook  enhanced commitment to  reduce 
"GHG  emissions within 60-70%, and  within 50-60%  with significant "
attraction of international assistance. 
 
This  will  mainly  be  achieved  through  the development  of  hydropower 
"resources,  the  potential  of  which  is  enormous  in  the  country.  With  the "
"global  community's  new  aspirations  to  achieve net zero ambition, we "
commit to doubling our hydroelectric capacity by 2050.  
 
"Additionally, to reduce emissions from the transport sector, we intend to "
"accelerate  the transformation  of the  country’s  urban  mobility, "
implement afforestation programs to increasing  the  carbon-capturing 
capacity of Tajikistan. 
 
"Of  course,  without  the necessary  resources,  i.e.  finance, capacity "
"building and technology transfer, the achievement of the assigned tasks "
"can take many  years.  Therefore,  for  many  developing  countries,  the "
proactive assistance of the international community is in great demand. 
 
"Given the national circumstances, Tajikistan would like to urge for more "
"focus on adaptation measures, enhanced accessibility and clear delivery "
plan for climate finance for developing countries. 
 
"Distinguished delegates, "
 
Tajikistan  looks  forward  to  working  with  the  Presidency  and  our 
development  partners  to  address  urgent  and  long-term  issues  in  a 
collaborative manner to achieve concrete and tangible results. 
 
Thank you very much!

                 H.E. Hon. Fanetupouvava’u Tu’ivakano 
        (The High Commissioner of Tonga to the United Kingdom) 
                                         
at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 26th Session of the Conference of 
"     the Parties also serving as the 16th Session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, "
             and the 3rd Session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement.

Mr. President 
Excellencies 
Distinguished Delegates 
Ladies and Gentlemen. 
 
"1.  On  behalf  of His  Majesty’s Government, and  the  people of  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga, may  I "
"    congratulate you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the Presidency for the 26th Session  of the "
    Conference  of  the  Parties to the United  Nations  Framework Convention  on  Climate 
    Change;  please be assured of the full support of the Tonga delegation in the critical work that 
    you lead  during this important global climate summit.  
 
"2.  I  also express  my sincere gratitude  to  the  Government  and  People  of  the  United  Kingdom, "
    specifically to the people of Glasgow for your warm hospitality you have accorded to us since 
    our arrival here in your beautiful city. 
 
"3.  Mr President, the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change "
"    (IPCC), is  unequivocal  in  its  findings that humans  are directly responsible  for  the  observed "
"    changes  in  the  climate;  these  changes  will deteriorate with  more  warming,  some  will  be "
    irreversible and some other effects will have existential ramifications for many of the peoples 
    living on atolls much like the Kingdom of Tonga.   
 
 
                                                                                Page | 2 

4.  Survival  from  the  impacts  of  Climate  Change  is nowhere  else  the  most  pressing  concern  and 
"    danger than in Small Islands Developing States, like the Kingdom of Tonga. "
 
"5.  The  effects  of  Climate  Change  continue  to  threaten  the  environment,  land,  the  ocean  and  the "
"    marine resources, upon which, the livelihood and existence of our people, depend very much on.    "
 
"6.  In Tonga, we have experienced (i) the increased intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones with "
    the 4 tropical cyclones in less than a month during our last cyclone season in February of this year 
"    (ii) over the past decade,  sea level rise with an average of 6.4mm per year; (iii) while higher "
    ocean  temperature result  in  coral  bleaching  of  the  country’s  reefs; (iv) record rates  of  coastal 
"    erosion, overflow and flash flooding; (v) salt water intrusion affecting groundwater quality and "
    increase soil salinization resulting in the reduction of crop yields; (vi) Drought leads to water 
    scarcity especially the outer islands where rainwater is the only source of water; and (vii) loss of 
"    critical infrastructures, assets and habitats in coastal areas.  "
 
"Mr. President, "

" 7. The Paris Agreement was a first step by the global community toward ensuring the very survival, "
"    of not only my country and other Small Island Developing States (SIDS), but more importantly: "
    this planet earth that we call home. 
     
" 8. We are here in Glasgow to progress our work, under this Landmark Agreement, and to stand in "
    global solidarity urging all countries to work together to address the challenges and to accelerate 
    actions to tackle the climate crisis. 

"Mr. President,  "

 9. We find a little solace in the IPCC Report that confirms that the 1.5°C limit agreed in Paris is still 
    within reach.   Let us work together to make it a reality.  We have acknowledged the efforts made 
    by all parties that have committed to ambitious climate actions.  
     
" 10. The Kingdom of Tonga is committed, to ensure rapid progression at the national level, towards "
    implementing the  necessary  actions  toward  achieving the  ambitious targets under  its Second 
    Nationally Determined Contribution and Long-Term Low Emission Development Strategies. 
       
     
" 11. Albeit our determination, the NDC Synthesis Report, and the UNEP Emissions Gap Report issued "
    in  September  and  October 2021both  indicate that  we  are  not  on  that  path  of  meeting  the  1.5 
    degrees goal.  
     
 12. We strongly re-emphasize the fundamental value and critical imperative in securing the net zero 
    emission target by 2050 and thereby limiting the temperature increase to 1.50C by the end of the 
"    century. Anything  beyond  the 1.50C threshold would spell  absolute catastrophe for Tonga, "
"    Pacific, the Small Island States and the world at large.  "

                                                                                Page | 3 

" 13. To meet these targets, immediate and enhanced actions must be taken now, for time waits for no "
    woman or man. 
 14. We will persist to call on everyone particularly the big polluters and major emitters for ambitious 
    emission reductions by 2030 and to implement commitments consistent with the 1.50C target. 
    Phasing out of coal plants and fossil fuel subsidies and investments are indeed crucial. 
     
" 15. What matters now is action. At COP, two important sectors are absent from all of our NDCs – "
"    the international shipping and aviation sectors, but we all share a responsibility to ensure these "
    sectors do not cause us to fail to meet our Paris Agreement goals.  
       
     
" 16. With their GHG emissions overseen by sister UN agencies, we must work to ensure the positions "
"    that we all take here at UNFCCC are consistent with our work at the IMO and ICAO. For Tonga, "
"    a large ocean state, our focus has primarily been on shipping.  "
     
 17. The solutions IMO must now adopt are a resolution at MEPC 77 in two weeks’ time that shows 
    that  it  is  unambiguously  aligned  to  the  Paris  Agreement  temperature  goals  by  elevating  its 
    ambition to zero GHG by 2050. And we must work at MEPC to secure the policy solutions that 
    can  achieve  that  decarbonisation – and  for  this  purpose  we  strongly  support  the  proposal  of 
    Republic of the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands for a levy imposed on shipping’s GHG 
    emissions from 2025 at the latest. 

" Mr President, "

 18. The  need  to  support  climate  adaptation  measures to  protect  our  communities  and  natural 
    ecosystems is of  great  urgency.  Tonga continues  to  use  its  National  Adaptation  Plan  (Tonga 
    JNAP2) to  dialogue with  donors  and partners  to secure technical  and  financial  support to 
    implement all of our adaptation actions for a Resilient Tonga.  
     
" 19. Conduct of Technology Needs Assessment, development, and deployment of the most feasible "
    technology for mitigation and adaptation actions in Tonga and Small Island Developing States 
    are  crucial.  Capacity  building  is also critically  needed  to  ensure  effective  and  timely 
    implementation of ambitious targets and commitments. 
       
     
 20. Without the necessary support we will take longer to implement concrete actions and achieve the 
    1.50C  degree  goal within  the  given  timeframe. We  continue  to  stress and call on developed 
    countries to keep their promise to mobilize at least $100bn per annum in climate finance by 2020.  
     
 21. We also call  on the  International financial  institutions to play  their  part in  facilitating  greater 
    access to the private and public sector finance required to secure global net zero emission by 
2050

 22. Loss and Damage also need dedicated funding therefore COP 26 must address the long- term 
    consequences of insufficient climate action in this area.  
     
 23. We urge parties to  complete  the Paris  Rulebook so  that the  Paris  Agreement can  be 
    operationalized. 

" Mr President, "

" 24. As one of many large ocean states present here in Glasgow, the notion of the climate-ocean nexus "
    is of critical importance to us from the Pacific Island Countries. We are deeply concerned of the 
    increased  acidification  of  our  Ocean due  to  increased  concentration  of  carbon dioxide and  its 
"    devastating effects on our reef ecosystems, fish and other marine resources hence affecting the  "
    entire fisheries upon which we rely on.   
     
 25. The  Leaders  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  at  their  51st meeting  endorsed the  Declaration  on 
    Preserving Maritime Zones in the face of Climate-Change Related Sea Level Rise. This is  an 
    important document for  it reflects our region’s collective position on how UNCLOS’ rules on 
    maritime zones should apply in relation to  climate change impacts such as  sea level rise.  It also 
    clearly states our commitment to maintaining our maritime zones without reduction from sea level 
    rise impacts.  

" Mr. President, "

 26. We continue to emphasize the importance of aligning the actions under the Paris Agreement with 
"    the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, Sustainable Development Goals, the SAMOA "
    Pathway  and  the  Kigali  Amendment  to  the Montreal Protocol  on  substances  that  deplete  the 
    Ozone Layer for their effective implementation. 

" Mr. President, "

" 27. It is  with  the  hope, that  this COP26 is a testament  to  the  genuine  partnerships  and  collective "
"    responsibilities of all parties, in raising their ambition and actions towards achieving the goals, of  "
    the Paris Agreement. 
     
 28. Survival of our children and future generation of our small and most vulnerable countries in the 
    world to climate change impacts critically depend on decisions made here in Glasgow at COP26.

       NATIONAL STATEMENT OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO 
            WORLD LEADERS’ SUMMIT AT COP 26 
  

  

"Mr. President, "

Your Excellencies 

"Heads of Government, "

  

"We gather today at a pivotal point in the history of humanity, in a "

further  attempt  to  deepen  commitment  and  determination  to 

mitigate the effects of climate change.     

  

The  August  2021  report  of  the  Inter-Governmental  Panel  on 

"Climate  Change  has  presented  a  sobering  outlook,  and  brought "

into focus the severe shortfall in closing the emissions gap.  Any 

temperature  increase  beyond  the  1.5  degrees  Celsius  level  will 

1
"have  long-term  and  permanent  consequences,  particularly  for "

small countries and economies such as Trinidad and Tobago. The 

"only solution therefore, is to increase collective ambition. "

  

"According to the World Energy Outlook, in order for the world to "

"shift  from  our  current  unsustainable  path,  we  need  to:  focus  on "

"driving renewable and sustainable electrification, improving "

"efficiency,  reducing  methane  emissions and  turbo  charging "

innovation.  We also need to implement strategies to unlock capital 

flows  in  support  of  energy  transitions  and  ensure  reliability  and 

affordability. 

  

"Mr.  President,  while  mitigation  ambition  is  driven  by  the  1.5 "

"degrees Celsius goal, the global goal on adaptation has failed to "

"achieve a commensurate level of attention and action.  At COP26, "

we  must  ensure  that  we  have  an  outcome  that  helps  to  raise 

"adaptation,  ambition  and action. Establishing  a  specific  work "


2
"programme after COP26, to define the details for the global goal "

"on adaptation, will be key.  "

  

Trinidad  and  Tobago  is  a  small  island  developing  state  already 

experiencing the effects of climate change.  Loss and damage are 

already  clear  in  the  aggressive  erosion  of  our  coastline  and the 

bleaching  of  our  coral  reefs.  Tackling  loss  and  damage  must 

remain  a  critical  and  core  issue  of  any  global  climate  action 

framework. 

  

We  are  increasingly  concerned  about  our  ability  to  address  this 

issue given the well-known difficulty in accessing financing for such 

projects. We need funds like the Green Climate Fund to establish 

specific streams for loss and damage finance to ensure that this is 

"prioritized in the same way as mitigation and adaptation.  Further, "

there  must  be  equitable  balance  between  public  finance  for 

mitigation and adaptation.  

  

3
COP26 will be a critical point at which we can assess whether our 

climate  finance  flows  are  headed  in  the  right  direction.  In  this 

"regard,  the  US  announcement  that  it  would  double  its  climate "

"finance  support,  is  particularly  inspiring.  This  is  the  type  of  bold "

action all donor countries need to consider in the weeks ahead 

The mobilization of private finance will also be critical for securing 

"the urgently needed investment, particularly for the transformation "

of our energy sectors. 

  

"Mr.  President,  we  must  complete  the  work  to  implement  the "

Enhanced  Transparency  Framework.    Even  as  a  small  country 

"with limited resources, we will make every effort to report to the "

"required  standard,  with  some  assistance,  of  course.  We  expect "

others  to  do  the  same.  This  is  the  deal  we  made  in  Paris.  We 

cannot go back on it now. 

 

 

 

4
"Mr. President, "

"As an economy largely based on oil and gas and petrochemicals, "

we  in  Trinidad  and  Tobago  recognize  our  responsibility  in 

"transitioning, over reasonable and manageable time, to net zero. "

We  have  set  very  ambitious  targets  aimed  at  diversifying  our 

economy.  We  have  embarked  upon  ambitious  plans  to  reduce 

"emissions and build climate resilience, but we will need help. These "

measures include the following:  

 

     •       We are in the process of establishing the largest utility-

     scale solar renewable energy project in the Caribbean with 

"     a  capacity  of  112  megawatts,  accounting  for  10%  of  our "

"     power needs, and we plan to increase this complement to "

     30% by 2030; 

      

     •       We  have  developed  an  e-mobility  policy  and  we  are 

     already  implementing  measures  to  phase-in  electric 

     vehicles. 


5
     •       We  recognize  the  need  to  address  the  socio-economic 

     issues  associated  with  the  energy  transition  and  have 

     developed a Just Transition of the Workforce Policy aimed 

"     at reskilling, retooling and developing new capacity for a low-"

     carbon economy; 

      

     •       We  are  pursuing  measures  to  facilitate  investment  in 

     green  hydrogen  to  provide  green  feedstock  to  our  vibrant 

     petrochemical industry. 

      

     •       We intend to explore the use of industry-generated CO₂ in 

     possible carbon sequestration projects. 

  

"Mr.  President,  COP26  has  created  great  expectations  and "

heightened  hopes  for  climate  ambition  for  Trinidad  and  Tobago. 

This  ambition  includes  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and 

providing  much  needed  climate  finance  to  enable  vulnerable 


6
"countries to adapt to climate impacts, and assist in transforming "

"their economies to more sustainable, low-carbon paths. "

 

"Beyond  the  rhetoric  and  pledges,  every  country  needs  to  be "

serious about urgent action in this decade. Trinidad and Tobago is 

committed  to  working  with  all  countries  in  the  multilateral 

framework to ensure a safe and secure world for those yet to be 

born.  It is my sincere hope that we will all be able to look back at 

"COP  26,  and  the  commitments  and  progress  made  here  in "

"Glasgow,  as  key  steps  towards  a  healthier  salvageable  planet "

Earth. 

 

"Let’s work for survival, of ours and all species. "

Let’s not choose extinction! 

"Mr President, I thank you.   "

             Tuvalu National Statement for the World Leaders Summit 
                    Honourable Prime Minister Kausea Natano 
 
"Mr. President, "
"Heads of Government,  "
"Leaders, "
"Excellencies, "
Ladies and Gentlemen. 
 

I first wish to express my profound gratitude to the Government and People of the United Kingdom 
for the kind hospitality accorded to my delegation. 

We are gathered here at the beginning of negotiations for COP26—a COP marked not only by 
clear evidence of the increasingly dire impacts of climate change and sea level rise but also by a 
far-flung pandemic that has again and again demonstrated the interconnected nature of our global 
"community. What we do at home reverberates around the world, reminding us of our collective "
responsibility to address climate change for the well-being of humanity. 

This COP must be a COP of action! We must act now to ensure that all States recognize their 
shared  responsibility  to  protect  the  global  community  and  to  ensure  that  all  States  are  held 
"accountable for this responsibility. We must lead the charge to develop global norms, practices, "
and meaningful changes to avoid the most devastating impacts of climate change and sea level 
rise. 

Tuvalu wishes to reaffirm the critical urgency of the climate change crisis facing Pacific SIDS 
despite our negligible contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. We urge World Leaders to 
"similarly  affirm  the  critical  urgency  of  this  crisis.  Rising  sea  levels,  extreme  weather  events, "
"declining  marine  resources,  rising  food  insecurity—these  are  the  alarming  and detrimental "
"consequences of climate change—the single greatest threat to our Pacific livelihoods, security, and "
welfare.  

"Mr. President, "

Despite the call made by Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in 2019 through the Kainaki II Declaration 
"for Urgent Climate Action Now to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, I "
"want to make it plainly clear that, even if all GHG emissions ceased tomorrow, Tuvalu, and other "
"low-lying atoll nations, are sinking and our land is fast disappearing.  "

"Under all current emissions scenarios considered, global surface temperatures will continue to "
increase until at least the mid-century. Global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C will be exceeded during 
"the 21st century unless deep reductions in emissions occur today. Right now, 40% of the central "
district of Tuvalu’s capital Funafuti is already below sea level at highest tide measures. These are 
"not predicted, future measures; this is the reality we are living with today. We cannot wait; we "
must make bold decisions and take firm action to secure our future.   

"Mr. President, "

We must conclude negotiations on the Paris Rulebook and safeguard the integrity of the Paris 
Agreement by stopping measures that will stall progress on its objectives.  

We therefore urge global major emitters to commit to stronger climate action and to formulate 
mid-century long-term low emissions development strategies. The success of this COP depends 
"entirely on the commitment of you, the global major emitters, and your readiness to help. The least "
developed countries and small island developing states are looking to you for you have the means 
"to  help  and  the  moral  responsibility  to  do  so.  Furthermore,  you  have  the  technology  and  the "
resources to save us.  

"Mr. President,   "

I travelled thousands of miles and through many transit points over 4 days to be here because I 
trust and have faith in international cooperation and multilateralism. For losing faith and trust is to 
accept the total demise of my country to sea level rise.  

My country has an average land elevation of 1.9 meters above sea level. The science is predicting 
our total submersion due to sea level rise within this century. This is a fate not unique to Tuvalu 
but similar to that predicted for other atoll nations and low-lying coastal areas supporting millions 
of lives and livelihoods.   

"Mr. President, "

I have faith in our collective humanity and our ability to achieve global solidarity to undertake 
"urgent climate change action NOW so that my country, Tuvalu, can have time to adapt and save "
ourselves. I am not asking for anything new. What I am asking for is what the Paris Agreement is 
"demanding from the international community, and particularly, from those of us who have the "
capacity and the resources to contribute to global efforts to curb climate change. 

"Mr. President, "

Global solidarity is central to addressing the climate crisis for the climate crisis is a global problem. 
Climate change is the greatest challenge of our time. It is wreaking havoc everywhere. Places that 
were once considered safe are no longer so. But climate impacts are only increasing in frequency 
and severity. Are we content to create for our children and their children a future of constant fear 
and uncertainty? A future replete with conflict as climate impacts exacerbate social tensions? None 
"of us, as responsible leaders, would want that for our youth and our future generations.  "

"Mr. President, "

"Let us bring ourselves closer to the problem. As a global family, it is time that we own the problem. "
"So together, let us take a human right-centered approach to the climate crisis. Let us focus on "
saving lives and livelihoods while we still have the slightest bit of time on our side. We can always 
"recover from financial crises, including those caused by pandemics, and we have demonstrated "
that. But these are nothing compared to the economic costs we face when the social fabric of 
societies is torn asunder as lands become uninhabitable resulting in uncontrolled migration and 
widespread forced climate displacement. 

"In Tuvalu, we are already living the future impacts of climate change now. Consequently, soft "
"adaptation approaches, such as nature-based solutions, help, but, at 1.9 meters above sea level, "
they will not save Tuvalu from sea level rise. Tuvalu urgently needs adaptation measures based on 
building physical infrastructure to save ourselves. We are investing in building raised reclamation 
lands to preserve our physical existence as a viable state. This is our utmost priority now. There is 
no  point  in  investing  in  soft  and  piecemeal  adaptation  measures  when  we  are  losing  our  land 
territory at an alarming rate.  

Easy  access  to  adequate  and  predictable  climate  finance  is  critical  and  we  urge  developed 
economies to raise their commitments under the Paris Agreement to mobilize US$100 billion for 
climate finance and constructively discuss a new finance goal for post 2025 that takes its floor at 
"US$100 billion and that is based on science. Beyond this, we must also strive to bring climate "
finance into the development paradigm. We must recognize that the finance needs of developing 
countries  are much higher than what  is  being  provided and mobilized and ensure that climate 
finance is clearly defined to guarantee that it is effective and meets the needs of all LDCs and 
Pacific SIDS. 

Tuvalu appreciates the funding assistance it has received to mitigate the impacts of the climate 
crisis and sincerely hopes to strengthen genuine and durable partnerships with our development 
"partners. However, we must dismantle our current thinking about climate finance and rebuild our "
"approach. Adaptation must be country led, efficient, and unencumbered. We can no longer adhere "
to  strict  rules  and  controls  that  leave  climate  finance  beyond  our  reach  and  that  stop  us  from 
"pursuing bold, long-term adaptation priorities. "

Targeted and appropriate capacity building and enhanced access to and transfer of the most viable 
"and  applicable  technology  is  also  critical  for  SIDS,  and  more  attention  must  be  paid  to  the "
technology and capacity needs of these countries. 
"Too often, medium and long-term adaptation finance and implementation have been left to the "
"private sector to handle. Private sector support is critical and should be enhanced, but it should not "
overshadow the important resources that can be offered through international public finance. We 
must mobilize large-scale adaptation financing now—financing that is not delayed by COVID-19; 
that  prioritizes  the  most  vulnerable;  and  that  is  sourced  through  the  Markets  Mechanism  and 
"delivered through public and grant-based financing, rather than loans. Our success as Pacific SIDS "
depends on this. We must cooperate to conclude Article 6 negotiations and finalize an Article 6 
"that delivers substantial  overall mitigation in  global  emissions,  as  well as  substantial  financial "
resources to assist vulnerable developing countries in meeting the costs of adaptation.   

"Mr. President, "

"However we adapt to cope with the increasing devastation of climate change and sea level rise, for "
"some of us, the capacity to adapt is waning, for technical and financial reasons. Consequently, we "
will bear the burden of significant costs due to loss and damage even at safer temperature levels. 
"Therefore, we call on all parties to cooperate and conclude the Warsaw International Mechanism "
and the work of the Santiago Network. 

We cannot allow the reallocation of adaptation funding to address loss and damage. We require 
"stronger guidance on loss and damage financing, and we must develop new financing mechanisms "
or funding windows for loss and damage. This  would include consideration of the impacts  of 
climate change on fisheries as part of loss and damage under slow onset events. 

"Mr. President, "

The existential threat of climate change and sea level rise has strengthened our resolve to preserve 
"our statehood and sovereignty. In this respect, we have embarked on international discussion on "
legal mechanisms that can recognize our maritime boundaries and assets as permanent despite the 
impacts of sea level rise. We must also ensure that legal mechanisms are in place to protect the 
"cultures,  languages,  and  heritages  of  nations  like  Tuvalu,  including  through  digitization  and "
building mobile digital nations.  

"We  must  uphold  domestic,  regional,  and  international  endeavors  to  this  effect,  such  as  the "
Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the Face of Climate Change-related Sea-Level Rise. 
This regional declaration was endorsed by Pacific Islands Forum Leaders this year and seeks to 
ensure that Forum Members’ maritime zones cannot be challenged or reduced as a result of climate 
change-related sea-level rise.  

"In the midst of COP26, we signed an agreement with the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda "
to establish a Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law. The 
Commission is authorized to request advisory opinions from the International Tribunal for the Law 
"of the Sea (ITLOS) on the legal responsibility of States for carbon emissions, marine pollution, "
and rising sea levels. We must support initiatives of this nature to develop and implement fair and 
"just global and environmental norms and practices, including compensation for loss and damage. "

"Mr. President, "

The impacts  of climate change are affecting the entire world  including  the Republic of China 
"(Taiwan), and Taiwan continues to effectively contribute to global efforts in combating the impacts "
"of climate change through renewable energy innovations, national policies to reduce greenhouse "
"gas emissions, and providing support for countries like Tuvalu that are at the forefront of climate "
"change. To truly and fully address the impacts of climate change, we must welcome the meaningful "
participation of Taiwan in the activities of the UNFCCC. 

"For atoll nations, the ravages of sea level rise will defeat all of our efforts and development gains "
with regard to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development 
Goals. Current global mitigation commitments and promises will not save us. For atoll nations like 
"Tuvalu, we urgently require the means to build raised reclamation land to save ourselves. All other "
adaptation measures are secondary and should come only after we have secured the continued 
physical existence of our land territory despite the effects of sea level rise.  

"Before  I  leave  COP26,  I  was  honored  to  be  given  this  scarf  just  yesterday – a  gift  from  the "
Aboriginal people of Australia. It displays the colors of global warming with the strong message 
to “stay safe in the blue areas” and I wear it today for Them and our People as well.  

"Thank you, Fakafetai Lasi, and may God Bless Us All. "
 












             
     


COP26 National statement 
             
             

"Your Excellencies, Your Highnesses, "
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
It is an honor to represent my country here at the 26th session of the Conference of the 
"Parties (COP 26), which takes place at a crucial time…. underlining the urgent need to "
accelerate climate action… for building a sustainable future. 
I thank the UK Presidency for hosting and chairing this conference… and for its efforts to 
strengthen our collective ambition for climate action. 
 
"Let me first convey to you the warmest greetings from the leadership, government, and "
people  of  the  United  Arab  Emirates.  We  approach  this  conference  in  a  spirit  of 
"cooperation, dialogue and partnership, in the same way that we have welcomed the world "
"to  Expo 2020 Dubai, where we are “connecting minds and creating the future.” "

"Honorable guests, "

"Sustainable growth has long been an essential part of the UAE’s development journey, "
"Our nation’s Founding Father, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, set out the principles "
of sustainability in all sectors. 
"These principles have been integral to our nation’s efforts to protect the environment, "
"diversifying  energy  sources,  and  developing  policies  to  reduce  the  impact  of  climate "
change. 
The effects of climate change are relevant to all nations… small or large... developed or 
"developing… rich or poor. Today, there is an even more urgent need to redouble efforts "
and strengthen action to reduce emissions and adapt to the impact of climate change - 
"through a realistic, inclusive and integrated approach that focuses on practical and "
commercially viable solutions … as well as the application of cutting-edge technology and 
innovation. 

The UAE sees an opportunity for economic growth with positive social impacts through 
"this  approach  to climate action. We  must hold  back  emissions,  not growth  and "
progress.


1
             
     


"Ladies and gentlemen, "
We have entered a new era of transition in the energy sector. 
The UAE views this as an opportunity to focus on new paths towards the future… 
We believe that investing in low-carbon solutions in the energy sector will drive economic 
prosperity. 
"Last month, the UAE launched the Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative… "
This is in line with the vision of the UAE leadership and reflects the ambitions we have 
outlined for the ‘Next 50’ years of our nation. 
"It was developed through a resilient, integrated approach focusing on the need for "
change…  and ensuring the participation of all stakeholders to create an ambitious yet 
practical agenda. 
It is also an open invitation from the UAE to the world … for partnership and cooperation  
to find sustainable solutions… while creating incentives for economic growth. 
The UAE believes that this growth must be inclusive… 
"Climate solutions should be flexible, taking into consideration the different needs of all. "
We  should avoid a one-size-fits-all approach. 

It has been many years since developed countries pledged $100 billion to support climate 
action in developing countries... Fulfilling this pledge will reduce the impacts of climate 
change and help developing nations adapt to it. 
"In addition, there is a strong need to create an investment ecosystem to support "
sustainable growth. 
The  UAE  has  been  a  pioneer  in  supporting  developing  countries  to  adopt  renewable 
energy solutions… 
"We have, for example, committed more than one billion dollars in development aid for "
clean energy projects in more than 70 countries. 
"Alongside IRENA, headquartered in UAE, we have announced 400 million dollars in new "
"funding for the Energy Transition Accelerator Platform, or ETAF… to boost investment "
and solutions in renewables. 
"Further – alongside the United States and over 30 other countries, we have launched the "
Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate to accelerate innovation for agri-tech. 


2
             
     


The  UAE  has  pledged – when it joins  the  UN  Security Council  for  2022-23 - to make 
climate action a priority. 
 
"The UAE has an impressive record in climate action, which helps establish an efficient "
"ecosystem that comprises all the elements necessary to scale innovation in this area, "
"including capital, research and development, technology and project implementation and "
operation. The UAE has invested over $17 billion in clean energy projects in six continents 
around the world. 
(PAUSE FOR CLOSE) 
"Honored Excellencies and Highnesses, ladies and gentlemen, "
"As  our  nation  celebrates  its  Golden  Jubilee  this  year,  it  also  celebrates  50  years  of "
sustainable growth. The United Arab Emirates is proud to have been endorsed as the hosts 
of COP28 in 2023 by the Asia Pacific Group of nations. 
"For this, I would like to thank all our friends and partners.... "
"We look forward to upcoming sessions and discussions in the next few days, anticipating "
your  support - if  the  UAE is confirmed  as  the  host  of  COP28  by  the  United  Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change. The UAE is honored to welcome all parties in 
2023 to work on developing practical solutions and make crucial progress on climate action 
Thank you.

                  Statement delivered by 

"  Ambassador Antas Sumbue, Vanuatu’s Embassy in Switzerland "

                   Republic of Vanuatu 

High Level Segment of the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United 
       Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 

"                   10 November, 2021 "

"                 Glasgow, United Kingdom "

           
"COP26 President, "
"Distinguished Excellencies,  "
High Level Dignitaries 
"Delegates, "
Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
It gives me great pleasure to join this High Level Segment of the 26th 
meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations 
Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on behalf of the people of 
"the Republic of Vanuatu, whom I have the privilege of representing at "
this COP. 

 

May  I  thank the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  through  the 
leadership of the COP Presidency for hosting COP26 Meeting in Glasgow 
this year despite the COVID pandemic restrictions experienced today. 

 

"Mr. President, "

"I stand before you today, concerned to my core about the onslaught of this "
"climate  emergency;  a crisis  that  is  devastating the nation of  Vanuatu, "
"taking with it our livelihoods, our natural resources, territorial integrity, "
"our cultural identities, our human rights, and even our lives.  "

 
The recent IPCC Special Report has highlighted that the world is moving 
towards a rise in temperature of 3 degree celsius and that Vanuatu as a 
"small island developing States, will continue to face natural disasters, sea-"
"level rise, droughts and ocean acidification. Therefore, as a small island "
"nation,  climate  change  remains  the  greatest  threat  to  achieving our "
sustainable development goals. 

 

"Even though we are not a major contributor of greenhouse gases, we are "
committed to working with the international community to redouble our 
"efforts to reduce the rise in global temperatures, so that, by 2030, 100 per "
cent  of  our  electricity  will  be  generated  by  renewable  and  sustainable 
energy.  

 

This  effort  is  part  of  our  nationally  determined  contributions. 
Implementation  mechanisms  of  the  Agreement  needs  to  also  trigger 
drastic and serious actions such as setting a moratorium on new coal mines 
and new fossil fuel extraction. 

 

"Mr President, "

 
Vanuatu urges parties to have new and updated NDCs that represent the 
highest  possible  ambition.  We  would  like  to  see  the  highest  levels  of 
pressure applied to parties who have not yet brought their NDCs in-line 
with 1.5-degree pathways. We urge parties to reach a consensus in the 
discussions for common time frames of the NDC.  

 

Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (PA) is an item of great importance and 
my country would like to see significant progress on the finalization and 
the operationalization of this Article. Increasing ambition on Article 6 will 
support  the  implementation  and  achievement  of  targets  specified  in 
"NDCs.  Vanuatu’s NDC reflects our firm commitment, aiming to deliver "
"the  PA  ambitions,  despite  having  ambitious  2030  targets.  This  is "
achievable  only  through  technical  and  financial  support. Vanuatu 
"however, perceived last week’s negotiations deviate away from the Paris "
Agreement mandate on Article 6 matters. 

 

"Therefore, I expect you to push for rapid decarbonization by 2030, starting "
with the eradication of fossil fuel subsidizes and agreement on no new 
"coal,  oil  or  gas  projects,  in  alignment  with  low  emission  development "
strategies and net zero emissions by 2050.  

 
"The climate finance mobilized to support Vanuatu’s climate adaptation, "
mitigation and addressing loss and damage is insufficient.  I expect that 
you will hold Parties responsible for meeting the 100 billion USD per year 
"commitment they made in 2009, and reaffirmed in the Paris Agreement in "
"2015.  Beyond 2026, that baseline amount must expand considerably to "
meet costs that will be in the trillions.  

 

"Loss and Damage is here and now, and the UNFCCC mechanisms are not "
delivering.  I want you to push for a fully operational Santiago Network 
"on Loss and Damage, one that serves as a technical and financial arm for "
us when we need it most.  

 

"The UNFCCC Transparency Framework must be strengthened, I would "
like you to call for comprehensive common tabular formats and reference 
"tables,  particularly  so  we  know  that  no  double  counting  of  emissions "
"occurs, and that the amount of climate finance mobilized and delivered is "
unambiguous.  

 

Adaptation is the top climate priority for Vanuatu.  I request for more 
"support to mainstream, integrate and implement National Adaptation "
"Planning processes, and start a robust process that will capture "
Vanuatu’s progress on adaptation in the Global Stocktake and as part of 
a new Global Adaptation Goal. Vanuatu request for stronger language 
on the Finance Function of the Santiago Network. We prefer language 
that requests potential SNLD hosts to make Submissions early next year 
so we can actually start responding to requests of the most vulnerable as 
soon as possible.  

 

"Mr President, "

 

My country strongly believes that science must be the ultimate basis for 
"our  work  and  welcomes  the  findings  of  the  IPCC  Special  Reports, "
"specifically the special  report on 1.5 Degrees, and the IPCC, Working "
"Group  1,  Sixth  Assessment  Report. Science  confirms  record  rates  of "
"increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and a terrifying approach towards "
"the 1.5 °C global heating limit.  Every year, and every degree brings the "
Pacific Islands new levels of climate extremes and climate suffering.  We 
need to heed the science. 

 

Human-caused  climate  change  is  undermining  Vanuatu’s  right  to 
"sustainable  development,  and  global  efforts  to  protect  planetary "
biodiversity and the future of our oceans.  Our government is prioritizing 
"legal  pathways  to  hold  polluters  to  account,  whether  state  parties  or "
"corporations, whether far away or in the Pacific region.   "

 

"These  grave  climate  injustices  must  stop  by  sustained,  radical, "
"and socially just cuts to emissions now, not later.  "

 

"For  29  years,  Vanuatu  has  participated  in  the  multilateral  climate "
"negotiations with good faith, ambition and hope that nations would be "
"able to work together to address the single greatest threat to the livelihood, "
security and well-being of all people on this plant.  

 

Although our delegates do not physically attending COP this year as our 
health experts have decided that it is in the best interest of our nation to 
"stay COVID free.   But, even from home, we have delegates  who are "
virtually engaging in the multilateral climate processes with the highest 
ambition.   

 

"Therefore,  I  call  upon  all negotiators  to  prioritize  action  over  politics, "
"resilience over economic gain, and justice over inequality.   "

 
"To the world, Vanuatu will be watching and following from afar.  We "
"stand  in  solidarity  with all  of  those who  have suffered,  like  us,  the "
excruciating pain of this climate crisis.  Vanuatu will be your advocate 
and friend in humanity.  

 

I thank you all!!

                          REMARKS BY  
"   H.E. Mr. PHAM MINH CHINH, PRIME MINISTER OF THE S.R. OF VIET NAM "
     At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties 
"                     (Glasgow, 1 November 2021) "
                                 
"Mr. President,  "
"Ladies and gentlemen,  "
    Climate  change  has  truly  become  the greatest  challenge  to  mankind.  Extreme 
"weather phenomena and sea level rise are seriously affecting the food and water security, "
"the sustainable development, and even the survival of many countries and communities. "
This warning from nature compels us to put forward strong measures and act responsibly 
"without further delay at the global level. As this is a global issue, a global approach is "
"required. As this issue affects every person, an inclusive approach is necessary. "
"    Therefore, I wish to propose the following:  "
"    First,  climate  change  response  and  the  restoration  of  nature  must  become  the "
highest priority in all development decisions. They must form the highest ethical standards 
"for all levels, sectors, businesses and citizens.  "
"    Science and technology must lead the charge, and financing must lend leverage to "
"the  transitioning  of  the  development  model  towards  a  green, circular,  sustainable, "
"inclusive, and humanistic economy. All that we do must be nature-based and centered "
"around people, for they are the actors and drivers of sustainable development, in order to "
leave no one behind.  
"    Second, all countries need to make strong commitments on greenhouse emissions "
"reduction,  grounded  in  the  principle  of common  but  differentiated responsibilities,  "
respective capacities and circumstances. Let me take this opportunity to call for justice 
and fairness in the fight against climate change. This is imperative to limit the global 
"temperature  increase. For  its  part,  although  we  are  a  developing  country  that  started "
                                             Please check against delivery 

"industrialization only over the three decades ago, Viet Nam will capitalize on its advantage "
in renewable energy and take stronger measures to reduce greenhouse gas emission. To 
"this end, we will make use of our own domestic resources, along with the cooperation and "
"support of the international community, especially from the developed countries, in terms "
"of finance and technology, including through mechanisms under the Paris Agreement, in "
order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. 
"    Third, climate finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building play a critical "
"role in ensuring the success of the Paris Agreement. Developed countries, being major "
"emitters in the past in exchange for present economic prosperity, need to fully meet their "
"existing financial commitments. At the same time, it is urgent for us to arrive at more "
ambitious financial targets for the post-2025 period. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
"    As one of the countries worst affected by climate change, Viet Nam is making every "
effort to both respond to climate change and foster economic development to grow and 
"ensure  an  ever-better  life  for  its  people,  while  contributing  responsibly  alongside  the "
international community. We look forward to advancing cooperation with international 
"partners through investment programs and projects, and sustainable development.  "
"    President Ho Chi Minh, the hero of national liberaration and world’s man of culture, "
"once said: “Unity, unity, great unity. Success, success, great success.” If we are to succeed "
"in the global fight against climate change, global solidarity is the only way. Together we "
"will discuss, work, and win. Our unity must stem from our will, awareness, and solutions, "
"and  endure  as  we  make  and  execute  plans,  and  ensure  resources. Our historic "
"commitments and actions will help preserve a green planet, a sustainable habitat, and "
lasting happiness for generations to come.

               STATEMENT
                    BY

  THE  PRESIDENT   OF THE  REPUBLIC  OF
                ZIMBABWE
" HIS EXCELLENCY,DR.    E. D. MNANGAGWA,"

                  AT THE

"WORLD   LEADERS   SUMMIT  DURING   THE  26"""
 SESSION OF  THE CONFERNCEOF     PARTIES
                 (COP26):
            1-2 NOVEMBER2021
"Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth IT;"

"The Rt. Hon. Boris Johnson, Prime Minister of the"
United Kingdom;
"Your Excellency Antonio Guterres, Secretary General"
of the United Nations;

"Majesties and Excellencies,       5"

I wish to commend the Government and People of the
United Kingdom for hosting COP26 and for extending an
invitation to Zimbabweto participate. I also congratulate
"Your Excellency, Mr. Alok Sharma, on your election as"
the COP26 President.

Zimbabwe has not been spared from climate change
challenges which have led to an increasing frequency of
severe droughts  and  cyclone  induced  floods.
"These, coupled with the economic sanctions imposed on"
us and the COVID-19  pandemic have had negative
impacts on the lives and livelihoods of the people of my
country.
The importance of solidarity and cooperation to tackling
"global challenges, cannot be over emphasized.It is most"
unfortunate that the impact of Climate Change is
"disproportionately borne by the vulnerable communities,"
which have contributed the least to the current stock of
atmospheric carbon.
                                  >

Vulnerable countries must therefore be capacitated to
"mitigate, adapt and build resilience to climate change."
The expectation is that major emitters will scale up
mitigation action and show greaterinterest in adaptation.
Decisions at this COP26   should strengthen the
implementation of current Nationally Determined
Contributions (NDCs).

It is further imperative that the set emission reduction
"targets are anchored on supporting, financing and"
equipping countries to gradually and sustainably migrate
from fossil to renewable energy.
 Notwithstanding that as a country we are “a net sink”;
 I am pleased to highlight that Zimbabwe has revisedits
 Nationally Determined Contributions and committed to a
‘conditional 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions
" reduction target, by 2030.Comprehensive strategies are"
 also being implemented towards mainstreaming climate
 change adaptation andresilience across all sectors of our
 economy. The removal of the illegal sanctions imposed
" on my country, will undoubtedly enhance the timely"
 achievement of our commitments.

 “Zimbabweis Open for Business” and my Government
 stands ready to welcomeandfacilitate investments from
 across the world towards greening our economy and
" achieving sustainable development, which leaves no one"
 and no place behind.

 MrPresident; The demonstration of sincerity and good
 faith by members will help restore confidence in the new
 commitments madeat this Summit.

 Consensus on a clear roadmap for the new finance goal
" mustbe reached, while carbontrading needs to go beyond"
" off-setting emissions, to more practical action on climate"
#NAME?

" Finally, let us all show bold and decisive leadership in"
 tackling this weighty  responsibility before us.
 Zimbabwestands ready to collaborate with all countries
 and partners within the comity of nations to achieve our
 noble objectives.

 I thank you.
