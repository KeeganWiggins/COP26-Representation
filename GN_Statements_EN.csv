"Excellencies, "
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
 
I would like to thank Her Majesty and Her Majesty’s Government for organizing 
"this significant and timely event. Special thanks to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, "
his  colleagues  and  the  City  of  Glasgow  for  an  excellent  summit  and  warm 
hospitality. 
 
"First, about Armenia - a small state but a global nation. "
 
"According to the World Bank analysis, Armenia is the 4th most vulnerable country "
to  climate  change  in  the  Eastern  Europe  and  Central  Asia  region.  Armenia  has 
registered a 1.3 degrees Celsius increase in temperature and a 9 percent decrease in 
precipitation. 
 
Despite the challenges by the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh 
"conflict, we are committed to a stronger integration into the global agenda on climate "
change and to demonstrating an increase in our climate ambition. 
 
Armenia  has  consistently  expressed  its  commitment  to  joining  global  efforts  to 
"combat climate change. In 2021, Armenia reaffirmed our commitment through the "
Nationally  Determined  Contributions  and  declared  an  objective  of  40  percent 
"reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, compared to the 1990 levels. "
 
The long-term objective of Armenia is to achieve climate neutrality in the second 
half of this century. 
 
"Transition to climate neutrality is at the core of the country’s energy independence, "
energy security and green growth policies. 
 

1
 
Our vision of resilient and low-carbon growth is directly connected to a solid and 
"effective  adaptation  strategy  based  on  an  ecosystem  approach,  reforestation, "
"investments  in  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency,  new  high  technologies, "
"promotion of electric mobility, and further development of nuclear energy. "
 
"Dear colleagues, "
 
Substantial public debt burdens most developing economies in their ability to access 
concessional and non-concessional climate finance. 
 
"In this regard, a creative approach is crucial. I am delighted to share with you our "
renewed  “Debt-for-Climate  Swap”  Initiative.  It  presents  a  new  climate  finance 
instrument. And it will help developing countries to adapt more efficiently to climate 
change finance and provide new economic opportunities. 
 
"Mr. President, "
 
"Exactly one year ago, during the war against Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan used "
internationally banned weapons to target not only civilians but also beautiful forests 
"of the large area, causing massive forest fires and creating environmental disasters "
in place. We call on the international community to step up its efforts to prevent such 
irresponsible and inhumane behaviour. 
 
"The environmental challenges do not recognize borders and conflict lines, and we "
should bring all states of the world into comprehensive cooperation. 
 
Now just a couple of words about this conference. 
 
"I thoroughly enjoyed the opening of the conference, enjoyed the speeches of my "
colleagues  from  worldwide.  Everyone  confirmed  that  there’s  the  big  problem: 
climate change. But that’s not the only problem that we have these days because we 
are also facing pandemic and economic difficulties worldwide; we are facing a rise 
"of populism, uncertainty, and unpredictability. "
 

2
 
"However, on the one hand, having all these problems, we have also recognized here "
"globally that there’s huge wealth, and that wealth in trillions of dollars could resolve "
"the issue. On the other hand, during the hundred years of development based on "
"quantum  technology  and  quantum  physics,  we  have  achieved  phenomenal "
"achievements in science and technology, and that technology today can resolve our "
"problems be that in climate changes, be that in Covid and other problems that we are "
facing. 
 
"So, where is the problem? Why aren’t we efficient enough? I think there’s one thing "
"we should learn from the history of science when 100 years ago, great scientists, like "
"Albert  Einstein,  Max  Planck,  and  Heisenberg  realized  that  the  classical  laws  of "
physics and mechanics could not be applied to the newly discovered small particles 
"and atoms. You have to change your mentality, you have to change your philosophy, "
"your logic, and even your common sense to understand and create the theory of "
quantum physics. 
 
We are at a crossroads. The world has become quantum. This is a crossroad that we 
"have to start thinking differently because the world that’s ahead of us, is not the one "
that was there 10 or 20 years ago. If we change our mentality and form our ambition 
"and strategy, then we can effectively use the finances and the wealth that the world "
created during this phenomenal development and use the technology to handle the 
problems that we are facing. But not only to resolve the problems but also to create 
the basis of development to the brighter future years to come. 
 
"At the opening of this Summit, Professor Brian Cox took us to a trip to Cosmos to "
see from the above how amazingly beautiful this Planet is and to realize that in the 
whole Universe this is our Home and the Only One and there is no other alternative 
for us but to work and to fight for this Green and Blue Planet. 
 
"Armenia is committed to become a really Smart State, devoted to our Nature, Planet, "
and Humanity. And I’m optimistic that we can overcome these difficulties and build 
a brighter future for all of us. 
 
Thank you.

580 Words: 

 

There is cause for optimism. 

18 months ago we were staring into the abyss of a one in one hundred 
years pandemic. The vaccines we would need had not only not been 
"invented, but there had never been a vaccine for a Coronavirus.   "

But here we are. Billions vaccinated and the world is reclaiming what 
COVID has taken from us. 

The challenge of combating climate change will be met with the same way. 

And it will be met by those who are largely not in this room.  It will be our 
"scientists, technologists, engineers, entrepreneurs, industrialists and "
financiers that will chart this path to net zero. And it is up to us as Leaders 
to back them in.  

"Technology will have the answers to a decarbonised economy, over time. "
"And achieve it in a way that does not deny our citizens, especially on "
"developing economies, their livelihoods or the opportunity for a better "
quality of life.  

Driving down the cost of technology and enabling it to be adopted at scale 
is at the core of the Australian Way to reach our target net zero emissions 
by 2050 that we are committing to at this COP26.  

Cleaner technology solutions must outcompete existing technologies if they 
"are to be successful everywhere, especially in developing economies. "

This needs to work not just in the developed economies of the North 
"Atlantic, but in the developing economies of the Indo Pacific as well. "

Raising the cost of the alternative just impacts on those who can least 
afford it. 
Driving the emergence of low-emissions technologies and fostering their 
widespread adoption is at the heart of all our plans to reach net zero. 

"That’s why we’ve set cost targets for clean hydrogen, low cost solar, low "
"carbon steel and aluminium, energy storage, carbon storage and soil "
carbon. 

And we’re not starting from scratch – 90 per cent of commercial solar cells 
globally use Australian technology. 

Australia has the best rates of rooftop solar in the world. 

Our installation of renewables is eight times faster than the global rate and 
three times faster than some of the most advanced economies. 

We have already reduced emissions by more than 20 per cent since 2005. 
"We’re ahead of the pack.  Over the same time, our economy has grown by "
"45 per cent, proving that economic growth is not at odds with emissions "
reduction. 

And by 2030 our nationally determined contribution here at COP26 notes 
"that our emissions will fall by 35% by 2030, far exceeding our Paris "
commitment. And we are doubling our initial climate finance commitment 
for our pacific family and south East Asian partners to $2 billion. 

Looking forward we are forging technology partnerships domestically and 
"abroad - with Singapore, Germany, the UK, Japan, Korea and Indonesia — "
and we are close to concluding one with India. 

Australia is investing over $20 billion over the next decade to drive the 
"transition, leveraging private sector investment to reach $80 billion in total.  "

We are also working to establish high-integrity offsets internationally. 
Working with our close friends and neighbours in the Indo-pacific. 

The scene is set. Global momentum to tackle climate change is building. 
Countries with net zero commitments cover over 80 per cent of world GDP. 
"In Australia’s case, 90 per cent of our exports are to countries with net zero "
commitments. 

"Our researchers, scientists, entrepreneurs, investors and our people are "
ready.  The Australian way is to bet on them — and that’s a good bet.

                                                   CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 
 
"Dear Excellencies, "
      ladies and gentlemen. 
 
Thank you for the opportunity to address this distinguished group here today. 
"And thank you, Prime Minister Johnson, for convening all of us at this critical point in "
time for this critical purpose. 
 
Our world is still in a state of emergency.  
 
"And if the past 18 months of the COVID pandemic have reminded us of one thing, "
"then it is that in order to manage a global crisis effectively, we all have to act fast and "
we have to act together. 
 
The same goes for our fight against climate change. And I can assure you that 
Austria is determined to play its part together with our partners in Europe and 
worldwide. 
 
"Domestically, in Austria, we are aiming at reaching Net Zero by 2040. "
       
"With this ambitious aim in mind, we strongly focus on the use of renewables.  "
 
"Currently, we cover over 70% of our national electricity needs from renewable energy "
sources. Our goal is to bring this to a 100% by 2030. 
"And we intend to achieve this milestone without using nuclear energy. In our eyes, "
nuclear energy is neither safe nor sustainable. 
 
Another priority is carbon pricing. We have just agreed a large-scale ecological 
turnaround as part of an eco-social tax reform. 
 
This eco-social tax reform lays the foundation for a certificate-based carbon pricing 
"scheme in Austria, while also reducing the tax burden on low- and mid-income "
families. 
 
"And, finally, we are investing more in public transportation and energy efficiency than "
ever before in our history. 
 
These domestic activities go hand in hand with our cooperation at EU and at 
international level. 
 
We whole-heartedly support the European Union’s ambitious climate goals and the 
EU’s updated NDC of a net domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of at 
least 55 % by 2030 as compared to 1990.  
"With this, Europe is setting an example and it is on track to becoming the first climate "
neutral continent by 2050.  
 
We also fully support the EU’s role as one of the world's leading contributors of 
climate finance. 
 

2
 
"As Austria, we have recently increased our contribution to the Green Climate Fund by "
100 Million Euros bringing our total share up to 130 Million Euros. 
 
"However, we have to be aware of one fact: "
"Despite all our efforts across all government sectors, be it at national, regional or "
"local level, we will fall short of our targets if we do not ensure the closest cooperation "
possible with the private sector. 
 
Cooperation with the private sector is and will be critical to protect our climate. 
 
Because radical reductions in carbon emissions can only succeed through 
cooperation and innovation. 
 
"Of course, each and every one of us, as individuals, as families, as societies, have a "
role to play to reduce our own carbon footprint. 
 
"But unless we change everything we do, we will have to rely on new ways of doing. "
 
"Only new, sustainable forms of industrial production, of transport technology, of "
"consumption, of housing and also of forest management will enable us to become "
fully climate-neutral. 
 
"These necessary innovations, I am convinced, can only come from close cooperation "
with the private sector – from scientists and entrepreneurs alike. 
 
And it is our task as political leaders to enable it and to support it wherever we can. 
 
"This is critical. Because if we failed to do so, we would risk a situation in which we "
had to choose between the economic health of our nations and the environmental 
health of our planet. 
 
And I am sure that you all will agree with me that neither is an option. 
 
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
The protection of our climate and our planet is one of our generation’s most important 
challenges. 
 
"A challenge that we need to live up to with determination, innovation and global "
cooperation. 
 
We as Austria stand ready to work alongside all of you in the years to come to live up 
"to this task, which history has placed before us. "
 
Thank you.

"          Speech by Rauf Hajiyev, Deputy Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources  "

                            of the Republic of Azerbaijan 

  26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 

"                     November 10, 2021, Glasgow, United Kingdom "

 

"Dear Chairman, "

"Your Excellency, "

"Ladies and Gentlemen, "

 

I sincerely thank the government of United Kingdom for organizing this important event and for shown 
hospitality. 

 

"The geographical location, complex and unique landscape, combining high mountains, desert plains and "
"coastal zones, makes Azerbaijan’s environment and sectors of its economy extremely sensitive to the "
effects of climate change. 

 

"The reduction of limited water resources by 15 percent over the past decades, droughts, an increase in "
the frequency and intensity of hazardous atmospheric phenomena increase the sensitivity of our 
country to climate change. 

 

"At a time when the world is facing the threat of rising sea levels, the level of the Caspian sea, a unique "
"reservoir in the region, is declining. This negatively affects the biological resources of the Caspian sea "
and all economic activities there. 

 

"Being aware of all the seriousness of the problem, Azerbaijan is actively involved into activities against "
climate change. 

 

We have chosen the path of green development. The country is implementing measures to expand 
"forest areas, increase the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficient technologies. "

 

"Despite the fact that we are an oil and gas country, Azerbaijan has set a goal to increase the share of "
renewable energy sources in electricity production to 30% by 2030. 

 

"At the same time, we continue to expand the network of a modern early warning system to ensure "
resilience to hazardous hydrometeorological events. We are open to regional cooperation in this area. 

 
"In the NDC, we made an ambitious commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions for 35% until 2030. "
"However, the occupation, in the past of 20% of the territory of our country by Armenia over the last 30 "
"years, the problems of 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons, the destruction of flora and "
"fauna, natural resources in the occupied territories have seriously hampered the implementation of the "
goals to mitigate the impact of climate change. 

 

"At a time when the world is fighting the consequences of climate change, joining efforts to reduce "
"greenhouse gas emissions, calling for the protection of the planet's forest cover, the Armenian "
occupation regime has destroyed a unique ecosystem on 20% of Azerbaijan's territory over the last 
three decades. 

 

"Currently, we have witnessed how tens of thousands of hectares of our forests were cut down and "
burned down by the occupation regime in the liberated territories. 

 

Today we look to the future. A number of important decisions have been made to revive the liberated 
territories. 

 

"Restoring these areas includes creating a green energy zone, introducing green agriculture, smart cities "
"and villages, and rehabilitating large areas of forests for a collaborative effort to tackle the impact of "
"climate change, both regionally and globally. "

 

We are pleased to announce the country's new goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for 40% by 
2050 and create a zero-emission zone in the liberated territories. 

 

"Of course, these goals can only be achieved by providing access to modern technologies and the support "
"of the relevant mechanisms of the UNFCCC, as well as international financial institutions. "

  

Dear conference participants! 

The only way to achieve a secure and sustainable future and reduce the negative impact of climate 
change is to consolidate efforts of all countries. 

 

Azerbaijan has already announced accession to a number of international initiatives during COP 26 in 
support of efforts to reduce the impact of climate change. 

 

"Concluding my speech, I wish you good health and success in protecting our planet during this difficult "
period. 

 

Thank you for the attention. 
The  Resumed  High-level  Segment  of  the United 
Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  2021 
(COP26)  
 
"Glasgow, 10 November 2021 "
 
"The Statement of H.E. Mr. Maksim Yermalovich,  "
the    Ambassador   Extraordinary   and 
Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Belarus to the 
United  Kingdom  of  Great  Britain  and  Northern 
Ireland 
      
"     Your Excellences, ladies and gentlemen! "
      
"     The  Republic  of  Belarus,  along  with  other  countries,  is  implementing "
international initiatives to combat climate change. 
"     In September 2021, the Republic of Belarus committed itself to make a new, "
"nationally determined contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By 2030, "
the country will use domestic resources to reduce emissions by 35 percent. Attracting 
additional external funding will increase the ambition of our contribution and lay the 
foundation for the country's further achievement of carbon neutrality in a time frame 
comparable to goals declared by the world's leading industrial countries. 
     Despite the fact that Belarus’ share in global greenhouse gas emissions is less 
"than 0.2 percent, we are responsible for the commitments we made and are striving to "
join our efforts with other nations. 
     No  coal  is  extracted  or  used  in  the  country.  The  main  share  of  the  energy 
sources in the Republic of Belarus is natural gas.  
"     In 2022, with the commissioning of the Belarusian nuclear power plant with "
"the state  investments worth more  than  10  billion US  dollars,  greenhouse  gas "
emissions will be reduced by 8 percent and gas consumption will begin to decline. 
     The share of renewable energy in the total energy balance is already more than 
9  percent.  Belarus  has  practical  experience  in implementing  de-risking  projects  in 
green energy area attracting private investors. 
"     Along  with  the  development  of  low-carbon  energy,  the  country  has  been "
rehabilitating  drained  peatlands.  Ecological  rehabilitation  of  1  hectare  prevents 
"emission of 11 tonnes of CO2. Currently, there are 1.5 million hectares of drained "
"peatlands  in  Belarus.  Therefore,  to  accelerate  the  process  of  their  swamping,  it  is "
necessary to join efforts and raise financing for these projects in the framework of all-
European environmental programmes. 
     Belarus has enormous  regional  carbon  absorption  potential thanks  to our 
"forests, which cover 40 percent of the country’s territory. Forests absorb a third of all "
CO2  emissions.  Taking  care  of  forests  is  not  only  a  state  policy  but  also  a  long-
"established  cultural  tradition  of  the  Belarusians.  Every  year,  our  residents  plant  a "
million trees with their own hands.  
     We welcome the intentions of the signatories to the COP26 Joint Declaration 
"on Forests and Land Use and share the principles laid down therein, designed to halt "
the loss of forests in the world.

     Distinguished delegates! 
      
"     In our world, the environmental well-being and health of every human being "
should  become  a  top  priority  of  modern  international  policy.  And  to  address  these 
"challenges, countries must work together to combat climate change by bridging the "
existing political and economic divides.  
      
     Thank you for your attention! 
                   STATEMENT  
"by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, "
" Željko Komšić, at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 "
 
 
"Dear Prime Minister Johnson, "
"Distinguished  presidents,  prime  ministers  and  members  of "
"delegations of all countries,   "
"Representatives of the non-governmental sector, "
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
 
It is a great pleasure to be here today and to have the opportunity 
to greet you all at this important conference on climate change. 
This  conference  takes  place  at  a  time  when  we  daily  face  the 
consequences of  the COVID  19  pandemic  and series  of  climate 
challenges that pose a difficult task for the future of the whole 
world.  
      
That  is  why  it  is important  to  reach  an  agreement  on  how  to 
"accelerate  global  action  against  climate  change,  in  order  to "
maintain  the  global  temperature  increase  below  1.5°C  and 
prevent climate change from spiraling out of control. 
     
Each  of  our  countries  faces  different  challenges.  Regardless  of 
"that, it is necessary to be on the same page in the fight against the "
"climate  crisis,  and  to  act  together.  It  is  also  necessary  to  set "
realistic and achievable goals. Significant financial resources will 
"be needed to implement those goals, especially in countries with "
"lower GDP per capita, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina. "
     
My country is making efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
"However,  in  the  coming  period,  we  will  have  to  invest  more "
energy and more funds in order to achieve the goals we have set 
for ourselves. I am pleased to share with you today that Bosnia 
and  Herzegovina  submitted  its  updated  Nationally Determined 
Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention 
"on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  in  April  this  year, reaffirming  its "
commitment to fulfilling the Paris Climate Agreement.  
     
"By submitting this document, Bosnia and Herzegovina becomes "
one  of  the  first  countries  in  the  Western  Balkans  to  adopt  an 
updated NDC with a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
33.2% by 2030 and almost 66% by 2050. 
     
"In order to meet our goals of climate change prevention, we are "
also working to enable the transition to sustainability and creating 
"an attractive environment for private sector investment in clean, "
affordable  energy.  We  will  need  substantial  international 
assistance in the areas of technology transfer and development of 
financial  mechanisms  to  encourage  decarbonisation.  The  same 
goes for financial support to the climate issues projects. 
"With  the  goal of  further  decarbonisation  of  the  energy  sector, "
Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Sofia Declaration on the Green 
Agenda  for  the  Western  Balkans  in  November  2020.  BiH  thus 
committed  to  work  together  with  the  EU  to  make  Europe  a 
climate-neutral continent by 2050. 
"In that regard, one of our current most important activities is the "
development of the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 
for  the  period  2021-2030  (NECP  BiH).  That  document  aligns 
multiple objectives: those of the European Union in the field of 
"energy  and  climate,  those  of  the  United  Nations  Framework "
"Convention  on  Climate  Change,  the  Paris  Agreement  and  the "
Energy Community.  
     
Our plan in Bosnia and Herzegovina will define goals for improving 
"the energy efficiency measures, increasing the share of renewable "
energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. 
It  will  also  include  the  policies  and  measures  to  achieve  those 
goals. We aim to set ambitious goals for each of the dimensions 
"of the Plan, which we believe are realistic to be achieved by 2030, "
and which will enable further development of the energy sector 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
 
I  would  like  to  emphasize  that  within  the  development  of  the 
"National Energy and Climate Plan, Bosnia and Herzegovina is also "
working  on  the  development  of a  Coal Region  Transition  Road 
Map.  Such  transition  of  the  coal  regions  and  the  entire  energy 
sector  in  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  has  to  be  a  fair  one.  It  must 
provide  for  the  switch  from  coal  to  renewable  energy  sources 
without any loss of jobs. 
 
"Regarding the energy sector, defining ways to finance the energy "
transition  is  of  the  utmost  importance  for  Bosnia  and 
Herzegovina.  The  energy  transition  will  require  significant 
investment in low-carbon technologies and infrastructure. Bosnia 
"and Herzegovina, like many other countries, will need substantial "
international  financial  assistance  and  support  for  the 
decarbonisation of the energy sector by 2050. Special focus must 
be on the planned closure of coal mines and the shutdown of coal-
fired power plants. 
 
There  is  no  doubt  that  Bosnia  and  Herzegovina  wishes  to 
"contribute to the fight against climate change. However, we will "
not be able to do this alone. We need the support. We have to 
cooperate with the countries that can accelerate this process with 
their knowledge and resources. Regardless of the fact that I do not 
"represent a country with a large population, it will be necessary "
for everyone to contribute to the efforts to stop climate change. 
You can certainly count on us.   
 
Thank  you  for  your  attention.  I  wish  everyone  a  successful 
"continuation  of  the  Conference,  which  I  hope  the  history  will "
remember as a milestone in the fight to save our planet. 
     
Thank you.

       PRIME MINISTER OF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA 
 
"Mr. President, "
"Your Excellencies, "
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
It is an honor to address the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. I would like to 
thank the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland for organizing this forum in extremely difficult times 
of global pandemic and to express my strong appreciation to the 
President of COP 26 Mr. Alok Sharma for the constructive dialogue 
involving all stakeholders. 
The last IPCC1 report contains scientific evidences that the more 
"frequent extreme weather events, we are witnessing across the planet, "
are a clear sign that the planetary warming is accelerating and is already 
"affecting many aspects of our lives, economies and ecosystems. Our "
presence here today means that we realize how important it is to work 
together and that more credible actions are needed by all countries and

"In this context, Bulgaria is completely determined to fulfill its "
commitments to the Paris Agreement. Along with the other EU member 
states Bulgaria will work for reaching the goal of climate neutrality by 
2050 and for the more ambitious goal of 55% reduction of greenhouse 
"gas emissions by 2030, which is enshrined in the EU legislation. "
"At a national level, we have developed an entirely new set of measures "
in our Recovery and Resilience Plan. It will become a new roadmap for 
"decarbonisation of the Bulgarian industry, and for reaching economic "
"growth within a sustainable and preserved environment, which "
includes phasing out of coal use by 2038 - 2040. Our efforts are focused 
on three main goals: accelerated further development of renewable 
energy sources and hydrogen; increase of the energy efficiency of the 
"economy, and sustainable mobility. "
All the measures that will lead to the green transition are carried out in 
the economic reality of today - the reality of an unprecedented 
pandemic and rising energy prices. Our main concern is the risk of job 
losses and the energy security of our country as we believe that only a 
"performing and vital economy can be transformed. Therefore, the "
national features should be taken into account for a fair and 
proportionate approach. 
"Bulgaria supports the united efforts of governments, private sector, "
academia and other stakeholders in our common goal to fight climate 
change. No country alone is able to face the global threat of climate 
"change, because we don’t have the option or luxury of failure. "
Let us join in our efforts to reach a new consensus among all countries 
on the necessary climate actions and goals to achieve global climate 
neutrality by mid-century as well as to agree on decisive short- and 
medium-term policies based on the right balance between mitigation 
and adaptation.  
I wish us all a successful outcome of the Conference.

"Your Excellencies, "

Climate change is the greatest challenge of our lifetime and this century. 

"Even with the most decisive  action  now,  it  will still irrevocably "
degenerate lives of generations to come.  

Resolute and urgent action now can – however – significantly reduce 
this decline.  

"As leaders, not only as concerned individuals, it is upon us to enact and "
implement policy choices to do so. 

"At a minimum, we must achieve the goals of the climate agreements we "
have already concluded and act more vigorously in their fulfilment.  

This is key to narrow the ever-increasing gap in areas where we are 
already off-track. 

We must also be more ambitious. 

This is a necessity. Achievable only if we act together.  

Joint  action is  possible  only  with the engagement  of  businesses  and 
"industries,  valuable  contribution  of  the  civil  society  and  the  overall "
support of our citizens.  

"Their  proper  understanding  of  effects  of  climate  change,  throughout "
"raising awareness and education, is crucial for winning this battle. "

"Ladies and gentlemen, "

Croatia takes nature protection seriously: 

We have the 4th lowest carbon footprint per capita in the EU. 

Croatia’s forestry  has  centuries-long  tradition  of  sustainable 
management.  

"With  93%  of certified  forests,  our CO2 absorption  rate  per  capita  is "
twice the EU average.  

Our Plitvice Lakes National Park are in the top five UNESCO World 
Heritage sites ranked by the size of the net carbon sink. 

"Altogether, 38% of our land is under protection.  "

"With 2 strict reserves, 8 national parks and 12 nature parks, we are a "
country blessed with immense biodiversity. 

"To  show  our continued dedication, I  wish  to  lay  out a  few of  our "
commitments:  

"   − Croatia will participate with, for us highly aspiring, 45% in the "

     EU’s ambitious goal of a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 
"     2030. Our coal phase-out year is 2033, but we will push to do it "
     even earlier. 

   − With its 2030-target for renewables amounting to just above 39% 
"     in final consumption, Croatia surpasses Europe’s goal of 32%.  "

   − We aim to have more than 65% of renewables and 100% low-
     carbon in final production.  


2
 
   − Croatia  sees  clean  mobility and  innovative technologies  as  an 
"     opportunity,  all  the  more  so  that  one  of  the  world  leading "
     companies  for  the  development  of  e-mobility  and  self-driving 
"     vehicles, Rimac automobili, comes from Croatia.  "

"   − As a country of a thousand islands, Croatia intends to contribute "
     to  the  global  goal  of  ocean  protection  by  having  30%  of  sea 
     within national jurisdiction under protection.  

"   − As  a  highly  popular  tourist  destination,  Croatia  intends  to "

     compensate the impact of tourists on CO2 emissions by planting 
     more than 1 million additional trees annually by 2030.  

   − We  are  enhancing  resilience and  increasing our aerial 
     firefighting capabilities by establishing  a  regional  centre  in 
     Zadar.  Its active  capabilities will  be  to  the  benefit  of  the 
     Mediterranean  climatological  hot  spot in  the  vein  of  what we 
"     provided this summer to fight fires in Bosnia and Herzegovina, "
     Greece and Turkey. 

"Ladies and gentlemen, we must all bear our share of responsibility. "

Fighting climate change requires challenging adaptation and enormous 
efforts by economies and societies worldwide.  

The cost of not doing so will be immeasurably greater. 

We can act willingly or end up being forced to act. Any delay will make 
the process infinitely more painful.  

Thank you.

  ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS 
      AT THE UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE [COP26] 
"                 GLASGOW, 2 NOVEMBER 2021 "
 
"Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, "
 
Allow me at the outset to convey my deep appreciation and sincere 
congratulations  to  the  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom  for 
"hosting COP26,  as  well  as  the  Secretariat  of  the  UN  Framework "
Convention  on  Climate  Change  for  organising this extremely 
important  and  timely Conference for  averting  the challenges 
associated with climate change.  
 
Challenges  that are  global and  can  only  be  mitigated  if  we  all  act 
"together,  with  a  sense  of  utmost  urgency  and joint commitment "
towards   enhancing   joint action   and  accelerating  global 
transformation to a low carbon and climate resilient society.  
 
Our target towards this goal was clearly identified six years ago at 
"COP21  in  Paris, when  we  collectively  pledged  to  cut  greenhouse "
"emissions  so  as  to limit  global  warming  to 1.5  degrees  Celsius, "
compared with pre-industrial times.  


1
  
 
"However, currently, and we have to be honest so as to strengthen "
"our  efforts  in  fulfilling  our  promises,  there  is  no  sign  that  we  are "
"growing  back  greener,  since  not  only  planetary  warming  is "
"accelerating,  but  we  are  witnessing  around  the  globe protracted "
"heat  waves,  devastating  fires  and  deforestation,  increased  water "
"scarcity, droughts, floods and extreme weather patterns.  "
 
That is why I have no doubt that COP26 can and should prove to be 
the historic milestone in the efforts to address the said devastating 
"impacts,  by  ensuring  the  highest  possible  commitment  from  all "
"participating  countries,  in  a  way  that  is  fair,  efficient  and "
"transparent,  whilst  maintaining  solidarity  towards  vulnerable "
countries that will be severely affected. 
 
"For  these  exact  reasons,  Cyprus  fully  endorses  and  supports  the "
"initiatives and declarations of COP26, namely: "
 
1.   The Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use; 
 
2.   The Global Coal-to-Clean Power Transition Statement;  
 
 


2
  
 
3.   The Declaration  on  accelerating  the  transition  to  100%  zero 
emission cars and vans;  
 
4.    As  well  as  the  US  initiative: The  Global  Methane  Pledge 
Initiative and the Greening Government Initiative.  
 
"Further, in addition to our commitment to adhering to the targets of "
"the  said  Declarations and  Initiatives,  Cyprus  also  remains  fully "
committed  to  take  all  necessary  measures  so  as  to  achieve  the 
"Paris  Agreement and  the  EU  targets,  with  the aim  of  achieving a "
55%  reduction  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2030  and carbon 
neutrality by 2050.  
 
"To  this  end,  and  as a first  step  in accomplishing  these  ambitious "
"but  highly-needed  goals,  my  country  will  allocate  more than 500 "
"million euro up until 2026, adopting new policies and measures as "
regards  using  cleaner  fuels - such  as  natural  gas  and  renewable 
energy  sources - and promoting  necessary  investments in  the 
"relevant  areas  of  Transport, Agriculture, Industry, Land Use and "
Forestry and Waste Management. 
  
 


3
  
 
"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Guests, "
 
"As  a  small  country, we  do  acknowledge  that  our  national "
contribution  towards tackling the  impacts  of  climate  change  is 
indeed limited.  
 
"We,  therefore, seek to  enhance regional  cooperation through "
"coordinated synergies  and sharing  best  practices,  taking  into "
account  that  the Mediterranean  and  Middle  East is  classified  as  a 
global “climate change hot-spot”.  
 
"Within  this  framework, we  have  undertaken  the  initiative  of "
"developing  a Regional  Action  Plan,  with  the  involvement  of  more "
"than 240  scientists  from  our wider region,  as  well  as  various "
"international organisations, who  are already preparing  policy "
"recommendations, measures and specific solutions.  "
 
With the finalisation of the scientific part of the Action Plan which 
"will establish the foundations of our future steps, within the coming "
months  we  will  hold  a  Ministerial  Meeting  and  a  Leaders’  Summit 
that  will initiate appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring 
mechanisms for the implementation of our commitments.  


4
  
 
"Dear Friends, "
 
"We  are  compelled,  and  people  expect  from  us,  to  take  on  urgent "
action  to  address  climate  change  and  I  am  certain  that  you  will 
agree with me that the time to act is upon us.   
 
Our  vision  should  be  none  other  than  to  look  to  the  future  with 
optimism  and  to  use  the  climate  challenge  as  an  opportunity  to 
"proudly demonstrate what all countries, what humanity can achieve "
when we join forces.  
 
"I have no doubt that by decisively cooperating and acting together, "
"with unity and greater urgency, we will be able to overcome the dire "
consequences  of  a  warming  planet  and  bring  forward  the 
"necessary  changes  for  a  sustainable  future, so  as  for our "
generation  and  the  coming  ones to  enjoy  better  health  and  living 
"conditions, improved air quality and a green environment. "
 
Thank you for your attention.

STATSMINISTERIET 
               
                                                     2 November 2021 
                                             
               
               
               
               
              National Statement of Denmark held by Danish Prime Minis-
              ter Mette Frederiksen at COP26 on 2 November 2021 
              Note: The spoken word is the official record.  
               
              Excellencies.  
              Ladies and gentlemen. 
               
              We have two paths in front of us. The first one leads to a future de-
              stroyed by climate change. Extreme weather events. Rising sea levels. 
              Wildfires and heatwaves. That is where we are headed right now.  
               
"              The other path leads to a green, sustainable future. Clean energy. "
              Clean air. Green jobs. Better lives. 
               
              It is not a real choice. The green future is the only way forward. And 
              we all need to ramp up ambitions.  
               
              Denmark will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent in 2030.  
               
              Our experience shows that green transition can go hand in hand with 
"              sustainable growth, jobs and welfare.  "
               
"              Of course, all countries need a fair chance. And all countries need to "
              take responsibility. 
               
              The richest countries have to deliver on climate finance.  
               
"Therefore, Denmark aims to mobilise at least 1 percent of the prom-"
ised 100 billion dollars by 2023. And 60 percent of Denmark’s climate 
aid will help the most vulnerable nations adapt to climate change.  
 
"Now, I will speak on behalf of the Faroe Islands and Greenland.  "
 
"As a self-governing country in the Kingdom of Denmark, the Faroe Is-"
lands have their own climate policy.  
 
The Government is now preparing their climate contribution accord-
ing to the Paris Agreement. This includes ambitious carbon reduction 
goals set by the national parliament early next year. 
 
The green transition of the Faroe Islands includes a conversion to 100 
percent renewable electric production by 2030.  
 
Greenland is a self-governing Arctic country of the Kingdom of Den-
mark.  
 
"In Greenland, as you all know, dramatic climate changes are already "
visible. This affects the livelihood and biodiversity in Greenland.  
  
Greenland has taken an important step to halt all new oil and gas ex-
"ploration licenses. In a few years, 90 percent of electricity produced in "
Greenland will be sustainable. 
 
"The Prime Minister of Greenland has informed me, on the Govern-"
ment’s decision to enter the Paris Agreement.    
  
Ladies and gentlemen. Now is the time to choose our future.  
 
"A brighter, greener future for the generations to come. Thank you. "

"    National Statement by Prime Minister Kaja Kallas, Estonia "
"             November 1, 2021, Glasgow, COP26 "
Distinguished Heads of Government 
Dear colleagues 
 
We share a deep concern for our people who struggle with the combined 
"effects of climate change, COVID19, economic difficulties, and in far too "
"many cases – real threat to life. Yet, I believe, we are hopeful. I am very "
proud that the European Union has adopted an ambitious climate law 
and is determined to make the green transition sustainable and just. 
The EU has proven that this can be accomplished without sacrificing 
economic growth.  
 
"You can afford it because you are rich, some say. We say: we will help "
you. Also Estonia has this year allocated 1.5 million euros to international 
"climate change collaboration, in addition to our development co-"
operation funds. 
 
But sometimes political will must come before money. There have been 
"many calls for action in different walks of life, from abandoning coal to "
increasing biodiversity. Some might say that these are only words. But 
those words have led to action in-between COPs.  
 
"However, we understand that not all calls for action are easy to join for "
each country. We all have our own economic models and specific 
"challenges. Estonia had a very difficult starting position, being almost "
completely dependent on energy from our national fossil fuel - oil shale. 
But we have already reduced our emissions around 70%.  

1
 
Green transition is a reality in Estonia. We aim to stop production of 
electricity from oil shale by 2035 and phase out oil shale based energy 
entirely by 2040.  
 
"We have been helped by the collective political will of the EU, its "
"carbon market, and its support schemes. But the change is driven and "
"implemented by the Estonian people, their openness to reforms, their "
"digital skills and a vision for the future. As I am proud of the EU efforts, I "
"am also proud of Estonia, our people, and companies. "
 
I mentioned digital skills. We believe that digital solutions have a big 
"role to play in achieving energy efficiency, waste reduction as well as any "
other green goal. We want to share our ideas with other countries at this 
conference and from here on.  
 
Data is an important building block in our joint efforts to fight climate 
"change. For this reason, Estonia has launched in the UNEP "
framework a new global cooperation called “Data for the 
Environment Alliance” or DEAL in short. I take this opportunity to 
invite all parties to join this initiative to improve data management 
capacities across the globe.  
 
I would like to sincerely thank the UK and the UN for organizing this 
"conference in these challenging circumstances. To our negotiators, I "
wish constructive spirit. Let the history remember COP26 for its results!

"Speech by the President of the Republic of Finland, "
"Mr. Sauli Niinistö, at the World Leaders’ Summit in Glasgow on Tuesday, 2 November "
2021
 
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
 
"more than 40 years ago, in 1979, experts from around the world "
met in Geneva at the first World Climate Conference. 
"In that conference, climate change was recognized as a serious "
"threat. In 1990, the IPCC published its first assessment report that "
highlighted the global consequences of climate change. 
"For decades, science has been sounding the alarm bell. During "
"these decades, we have gained more knowledge. We know the "
risks.  
 
"A lot has been done. The Paris Agreement was a historic milestone, "
"and after that, many countries have set new climate goals.Finland "
belongs to the most ambitious: we aim to be carbon neutral by 
2035
 
But we have reached a point where we need to move beyond goals 
and pledges. Change may seem inconceivable but only until we act. 
Combatting climate change is one of our weightiest human 
responsibilities.  
                         *** 
Ensuring adequate climate finance is crucial. Finland is doing its 
part by almost doubling its climate finance to developing countries. 
"By co-chairing the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, "
we also encourage the integration of climate action into national 
budgeting. Many truly impactful measures lie in this domain.  
   
"As an arctic country, Finland is particularly concerned about the "
fast-warming Arctic region. Everyone else should be concerned too: 
"if we lose the arctic, we lose the globe. In the Arctic, reducing black "
carbon and methane emissions is essential.  
 
"No emission reduction measures will be enough, if we don’t take "
"care of our carbon sinks. As the most forested country in Europe, "
Finland places great importance to sustainable use of forests. 
"Every year, 150 million trees are planted in Finland. Globally, we "
need to strengthen efforts to halt forest loss. 
                         *** 
"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
 
The original title of the 1979 World Climate Conference was ”A 
Conference of Experts on Climate and Mankind”.Already more than 
40 years ago we knew that climate change is the result of the 
"actions of mankind, and that it can determine the future of mankind. "
Now it is time to deliver on our pledges and shoulder our human 
responsibilities.  
 
 
   
 
 
"Dear President, "
"Excellencies,  "
"Distinguished delegates,  "
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
  
On  behalf  of  the  people  of  Georgia  and  our COP26 
"Delegation, it is a great privilege for me to address this "
historic gathering. 
 
Allow  me  to  express  my sincere  appreciation  to  the 
United Kingdom for its dedication to bring us together 
and make the COP26 a reality in light of the ongoing 
challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
"Excellencies, we all know that our living environment "
is changing. [PAGE 1] 
 


                                        
"The Caucasus – a beautiful land of mountains, glaciers, "
and rivers -- has already lost 40 percent of its glaciers. 
"During the last two decades alone, the speed of glacier "
loss  in  the  eastern Georgia  has  exceeded  projections 
from the end of the twentieth century. 
  
We fully share the alarm presented by UN Secretary-
General’s latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on  Climate  Change that  declared a “code  red  for 
humanity.”  
 
The  report makes  crystal clear that  the  combined 
commitments of  each  nation  in  the Nationally 
Determined  Contributions  are  insufficient  to  reduce 
"atmospheric greenhouse gases below dangerous levels, "
and that greater ambition and effort is needed if we are 
to meet the long-term temperature goals of the Paris 
Agreement and avert a global disaster. [PAGE 2] 

                                        
   
"The challenges are clear, but so are the solutions. "
  
We  must  rise  to  these  challenges  and  increase  our 
"commitment  to  developing  more  productive,  stable "
and  resilient  societies.  The  investments  in  clean 
"energy,  climate-smart  agriculture,  and  enhanced "
adaptive capacity represent concrete steps for reducing 
emissions  and  preparing  our  societies  for  the 
unavoidable  impacts  of  climate  change. We  must 
embrace  the  Secretary  General’s  key  proposals  to 
“protect  our  planet”  reflected  in  Our  Common 
Agenda. [PAGE 3] 
  
 
 
 


                                        
"In  that  spirit,  Georgia  has  committed by  2030 to "
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by more than half 
"compared  to  its  1990  levels, and  to  deepen  the "
understanding  of  its  adaptive  capacity  to  climate 
change  through  international  partnerships.  The 
Government of Georgia has a development plan with 
a clear vision for 2030 that aligns perfectly with the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  
 
"For its part, Georgia will achieve this by diversifying "
its  renewable  energy  sector;  expanding  the  share  of 
wind  and  solar segments in  its  energy  market; 
transforming the country’s urban mobility; developing 
"low-carbon approaches in the construction, industrial, "
and  waste  sectors;  advancing  climate-smart 
technologies and services; and increasing the carbon-
capturing  capacity  of  Georgia’s magnificent 
forests. [PAGE 4] 

                                        
  
"Of course, we are here because none of us can meet "
these challenges alone. 
  
"Leaders  from government,  industry,  academia, "
"subject-matter  professionals, technical  experts  and "
stakeholders in every community from every country 
and  from  every  region  must  act  jointly  to  solve  the 
climate crisis by building a low-carbon and resilient 
economies. From  small  towns  and  villages  to  large 
"urban  areas,  we must  all  pledge  to  the younger "
"population today  and  for  future  generations, that "
preserving our planet is non-negotiable. We must act. 
  
"Lastly,  let  me  mention  that the COP26  has  critical "
importance  for  our  national and  regional  interest. 
[PAGE 5] 
  

                                        
"Equitable  geographical  representation,  the  sovereign "
equality  and  dignity  of  all  states  are  fundamental 
bedrock principles of the United Nations. 
 
Georgia  wishes  to  realize  the  widest  possible

preamble in response to this uniquely global challenge.  
Georgia wishes to thank the Presidency and all Parties 
for their spirit of compassion and their willingness to 
"move forward on agenda related proposals, including "
the  need  to  address  equitable  geographical 
representation. 
 
Georgia looks forward to working with the Presidency 
and  our  partners  to  address  these  issues  in  a 
"collaborative,  transparent,  and  equitable  manner.  "
[PAGE 6] 
 

                                        
No one should be left behind in this fight!  
 
Georgia looks forward to bold and visionary outcomes 
from COP26  that will dramatically  advance  our 
collective climate  ambition  and  help  us  build  back 
"from  the  pandemic -- greener,  stronger, and  more "
secure than ever. The next generation are counting on 
us to deliver on our promise.

"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "

It is an honor to address you today. Let me start by stating the obvious:
we are running out of time and we need to act now. 
 
"In Greece, as in many other countries, we are already getting a glimpse"
of the dramatic effects of global warming. Having experienced a record-
"breaking streak of days with temperatures over 40 degrees, we had to"
deal with forest fires of unprecedented  intensity. 

To tackle such challenges we created a Climate Crisis Ministry.  We
emphasize the term Climate Crisis because we are already in need of
urgently addressing the consequences of climate change. But we also
need to act preemptively.  

"Think big, act fast and lead by example is my political credo. Greece,"
despite its small carbon footprint can make a significant contribution in
the green transition that goes beyond our ambitious European goals of
reducing emissions by 55% by 2030.
 


1
   Let me highlight 6+1 initiatives starting from shipping: 
    

"1. The  Greek-owned  commercial  fleet  is  a  maritime  superpower,"
   accounting  for  20%  of  the  global  fleet.  We  are  taking  the  lead  in
   proposing solutions for the decarbonisation of maritime transport. The
"   availability of mature technologies is key to this process, hence our"
   proposal for an EU Research Centre for Alternative Marine Fuels and
   Technologies.
    

"2. Moving to tourism, the climate crisis poses a big threat to Mediterranean"
   tourist destinations. Our pioneering GR-eco strategy will eliminate more

   than 10 million tons of CO2 by gradually turning our islands into 100%
   green and energy autonomous destinations. 
    

"3. Renewables. Beyond traditional wind and solar, we aim to be leaders in"
   off-shore wind with an installed base of 2 GW by 2030.  We also want to
"   be innovators in pumped-storage hydroelectricity, taking advantage of"
   the country’s unique geomorphology. 
    

4. Phasing-out coal. We are transitioning to low-carbon electrification at a
   faster pace than most European countries. Greece will be lignite free
   the latest by 2028 while all old lignite units will be phased out by 2023.


2
"5. Ecosystems. We will protect our forests, mountains and seas from the"
   risks  of  climate  change.  We  are  taking  regulatory  action  to  protect
   marine biodiversity by aiming to declare 10% of our seas as no catch
   zones by 2030. And we are introducing the flagship project “Untrodden
   Mountains” with the aim to protect our mountains’ natural habitat. 
    

6. Interconnections. Greece is steadily transforming into a regional hub for
   green energy. Our recent agreement with Egypt for a new electricity
   interconnection is a case in point.   Greece is also the logical entry point
   for  green  hydrogen  produced  in  the  Middle  East into  the  European
   market.

"   Last but not least, the cabinet will approve this week our new climate bill"
   which will set ambitious targets with regard to climate change.  
    
   One  last  remark:  the  natural  gas  price  crisis  should  not  derail  our
"   strategy of decarbonization. Instead, we should move faster and think"
"   out of the box, particularly when it comes to financing green transition."

"   Ladies and gentlemen, "

   We have reached a stage where there is no room for petty politics. Our
   children and the generations to come will not forgive us if we fail to
   coordinate  and  address  this  existential  threat  for  humanity.  Starting
"   today, I firmly believe that we can live up to the challenge. "

                                   Holy See 
 
"Excellency,  "
"Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
"I have the honor of read an excerpt of the Message of Pope Francis, addressed to the President of "
this Conference. 
 
     We can achieve the goals set by the Paris Agreement only if we act in a coordinated and 
"responsible way. Those goals are ambitious, and they can no longer be deferred.  Today it is up to "
you to take the necessary decisions. 
"     We are facing an epochal change that calls for commitment on the part of all, particularly "
those countries possessed of greater means. These countries need to take a leading role. 
"     For its part, the Holy See has adopted a strategy of net-zero emissions operating on two "
levels:  1)  the  commitment  of  Vatican  City  State  to  achieve  this  goal  by  2050;  and  2)  the 
commitment of the Holy See to promote education in integral ecology to favour a cultural model 
of development and of sustainability centred on fraternity and on the covenant between human 
beings and the natural environment. 
"     Along  these  same  lines,  on  4  October  last,  I  joined  a  number  of  religious  leaders  and "
scientists in signing a Joint Appeal in view of COP26.  What clearly emerged was a remarkable 
"convergence  on  the  urgent  need  for  a  change  of  direction,  a  decisive  resolve  to  pass  from  the "
“throwaway culture” prevalent in our societies to a “culture of care” for our common home and 
"its inhabitants, now and in the future. "
     Humanity possesses the wherewithal to effect this change. Especial care must likewise be 
"shown  for  the  most  vulnerable  peoples,  in  whose  regard  there  is  a  growing  “ecological  debt” "
related to commercial imbalances with environmental repercussions and to the disproportionate 
use of the natural resources of one’s own and of other countries.  The “ecological debt” raises in 
"some  ways  the  issue  of  foreign  debt,  the  burden  of  which  often  hinders  the  development  of "
peoples.   
"     [We can and must restart from a consideration of all these aspects, along with the setting in "
"place of carefully negotiated procedures for forgiving foreign debt, linked to a more sustainable "
and just economic restructuring aimed at meeting the climate emergency.]   
"     Sadly, we must acknowledge how far we remain from achieving the goals set for tackling "
climate change.  This cannot continue!  There is no time to waste.  All too many of our brothers 
"and sisters are suffering from this climate crisis.  Now is the time to act, urgently, courageously "
and responsibly.   
"     The young, who in recent years have strongly urged us to act, will only inherit the planet "
"we choose to leave to them, based on the concrete choices we make today.  Now is the moment "
for decisions that can provide them with reasons for hope and trust in the future. 
     I accompany you with my prayers as you take these important decisions. 
     Thank you 
Ladies and gentlemen 
"We are gathered at this global climate meeting, the most significant one since "
the  historic  Paris  conference.  We  agreed  in  Paris  to  keep  global  warming 
"within safe limits, and to upgrade our national contributions as needed for "
that purpose. That time has now come. We have received new guidance from 
science and the evidence is stronger. Our combined Paris pledges will not 
suffice. We need to upgrade.  
"Iceland announced last year an upgrade of our ambition level, from 40 to 55 "
per cent emissions cuts to 2030. We will achieve this goal in cooperation with 
the EU and its Member States and with Norway.  
Earlier this year the Icelandic Parliament made our previously announced goal 
of carbon neutrality by 2040 legally binding. Iceland is one of few countries 
that has taken this step. We are working on a roadmap to carbon neutrality; 
a  big  step on  that  journey is  our newly released Long-Term Low  Emission 
"Strategy, in line with the Paris Agreement. Iceland has set a goal of quitting "
"fossil fuel use by 2050. Last September, Iceland published its first adaptation "
strategy.  
The parties who are now forming a new government in Iceland are currently 
discussing ways to strengthen our 2030 target while ensuring a just transition 
"towards a greener economy. In climate mitigation, we believe we are on the "
"right track, but we want to do better still. As part of its renewed NDC, Iceland "
has increased  its  year-on-year  funding  for  climate  related  development 
programs and projects significantly and continues to do so.   
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
"Targets are important, but action is essential. We know what we need to do. "
We  need  energy  conservation  and  renewables  to  replace planet-cooking 
fossil fuels. We need to stop devouring forests and wetlands that are valuable 
carbon sinks and bastions of biodiversity. We need to scale up on tested clean 
"solutions,  and we  need  green  technology  and  innovation.  We  need  civil "
"society and all sectors to contribute, but governments have to lead the way.  "
In  Iceland we  have  some  good  stories  to tell:  100%  renewable energy  for 
heating and electricity; second in the world in the share of clean cars in total 
sales. This is because governments made wise decisions in the past and this 
is what governments need to keep on doing. But we need to do more. 
We need clean energy transition to extend to ships and airplanes. 
We must do better in nature-based solutions. In Iceland we have doubled our 
"efforts in the last three years or so. But we need to redouble them, at least.  "
We must look for negative emissions and new technology. Just two months 
"ago, the world‘s first direct air capture and storage plant opened in Iceland. "
The CO2 is being pumped in the basalt ground where it is petrified. We hope 
this is a small first step towards something bigger. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
"Your time is the time of the people you know and love, the time that moulds "
you. And your time is also the time of the people you will know and love. The 
time that you will shape. Everything you do matters. You create the future 
every single day. 
"These are the words of an Icelandic author, Magnason. And his words are "
"true: The time to create the future is now, today. "
Young people are pressing for actions; we must heed their call. I also want to 
underscore  the  importance  of  gender  equality  in  our  discourse.  We  must 
involve women and girls in all aspects of climate action and decisions – we 
need the energy and ingenuity of all of humankind.  
"The signs of climate disruption are ominous, we see emergencies around the "
world that are a direct consequence of the climate crisis. In Iceland we see 
our glaciers  receding. We  worry  about  the  change  of  chemistry  and 
circulation  in  our  oceans  in  ways  that  could  disrupt  the  entire  marine 
ecosystem.  
"But there are also signs of progress, that give ground for hope and optimism. "
The promise of the Paris Agreement is alive and well. I sense great ambition 
"and will here in Glasgow. There is demanding work ahead, but it can be good "
work as well. Green transition can and must be the growth story of the 21st 
"Century, and save the day – and the planet.  "
 
"Thank you, "
                 COP26 World Leader’s Summit 
           Statement by Prime Minister KISHIDA Fumio 
 
"At the outset, let me start by commending my friend, Boris, for his "
leadership in hosting the COP 26. 
 
I have come all the way to Glasgow to convey my own determination that 
"Japan will be working in full force to take on climate change, a common "
challenge of humankind. 
 
Six years have passed since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. 
 
"At that time, under the leadership of then President Laurent Fabius, we had "
renewed our resolve. We must not forget that very moment. 
 
"“Fumio, I really want to give this to you.” To this day, I have been keeping "
and cherishing the gavel that my friend Laurent presented to me as a 
testament to my own resolution to confront the climate issue seriously. 
 
"To achieve our goal, this coming decade will be critical. "
"Together, with high ambitions, let us do all we can going forward! "
 
“Net-zero by 2050”; 
Japan will realize this goal under our newly adopted Long-term Strategy.  
I assure that Japan aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46% in 
"the  fiscal  year  2030  from  its  fiscal  year  2013  levels, and  that Japan  will "
continue strenuous efforts in its challenge to meet the lofty goal of cutting its 
emissions by 50%. 
 
"Mr. President,  "
"To bring  about a decarbonized  society, Japan  will introduce renewable "
"energy as much as possible, and lead the way in the clean energy transition, "
with a particular focus on Asia.  
 
"Since solar power plays a major role in the transition to renewables in Asia, "
"to  help stabilize electrical  frequency in  the  region,  converting  existing "
thermal  power  generations  into  zero-emission power  generation is a 
necessary path. 
 
"To this end, Japan, through the Asia Energy Transition Initiative, will develop "
leading  projects worth 100  million USD to  transform  fossil-fuel-fired 
thermal  power into  zero-emission  thermal  power such  as ammonia  and 
hydrogen. 
 
Developed countries are collectively committed to the 100 billion USD per 
"year goal of climate finance. However, we have not yet achieved this target. "
 
"In  order  to lead the  initiative  in  fulfilling  this  financial  gap, today,  I  am "
pleased to announce our additional contribution. 
 
Japan  announced  last  June  our  contribution  to  provide  support  worth  60 
"billion USD, both in public and private finance, in the next five years. "
 
"On top of that, Japan will provide up to 10 billion USD in the coming five "
"years,  which  would  include  our  contribution  to  the  launch  of  Innovative "
Financial  Facility  for  Climate  as  we  partner  with  the Asian  Development 
Bank and others to support the decarbonization of Asia and beyond. 
  
"Together with Boris, Japan will call on other developed countries to join us "
in our collective efforts.  
 
"Capitalizing on these initiatives, Japan will press onward to undertake efforts "
"toward net-zero emissions in Asia, the engine of global economic growth. "
 
"With an aim to realizing a future where vehicles, the world’s essentials, will "
"become zero emission, Japan will take advantage of all the available options "
of technologies. 
 
"By  utilizing our own 2  trillion  yen  Green  Innovation  Fund,  Japan  will "
"develop next-generation batteries and motors, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels, "
which all hold the key to the spread of electric vehicles. 
"While  spreading  the  fruits of  these  innovations across  Asia, Japan will "
spearhead global efforts. 
 
"Furthermore, Japan will be participating in the Global Methane Pledge. "
 
"As we are moving forward in the transition to decarbonization, the ongoing "
issue of rising energy prices also calls for our joint discussions among 
leaders to meet the challenge. 
 
"For adaptation to climate change, Japan will double our assistance to "
approximately 14.8 billion USD such as in the area of disaster risk 
reduction.  
"Concerning global forestry conservation, I hereby announce that Japan will "
"provide financial assistance worth approximately 240 million USD, "
utilizing advanced technologies and working in collaboration with the 
international organizations. 
 
No one must be left behind as we confront the issue of climate change. 
Japan will dedicate all its strength to undertake actions and contribute to the 
future of humankind. 
 
Thank you.

"Mr. President, "
"Excellencies, "
Distinguished Delegates 
Ladies and Gentlemen 
 
Let me start by expressing my gratitude to the Government of the United King-
dom for their huge efforts to welcome all of us in Glasgow and to assure the 
continuity of international climate diplomacy at times of a global pandemic. 
The fact that so many of us are present at the highest possible political level is a 
proof of the importance and urgency of the topic. I truly hope that today and in 
"the coming two weeks, we will not only speak about climate change. We must "
"move forward, increase ambition and turn our collective and individual com-"
mitments into true action. We need a concrete and positive outcome of the 
COP26 and Liechtenstein will support the Presidency as much as possible to 
succeed. 
 
Our meeting today is much more than just a conference about climate change. 
"It is a conference about the future of our planet, the future of our States and "
the future of humankind. It is our moral duty to ensure a liveable planet and a 
healthy environment for future generations. A dialogue with the youth is es-
sential. We must also listen to science and the IPCC in particular. What does 
science tell us? Global warming is not simply a raise in temperatures that leads 
to more extreme weather conditions and deteriorates biodiversity. If we do not 
"succeed to limit global warming below 1.5 °C, we will be unable to ensure food "
"security, water and sanitation in many regions of the world. Inundation due to "
sea-level rise threatens the ability of Small Island States to express their peo-


2
                                                           
ples’ right to self-determination through Statehood. New conflicts about re-
"sources and forced migration will emerge, if we do not succeed in our individ-"
"ual and collective efforts. In short, climate change is a global security threat "
that calls for collective multilateral action. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable De-
velopment must therefore guide all our decisions.  
 
The time for decisive global action is now and Liechtenstein urges all States to 
take up their global responsibility. Every state can and must contribute to 
tackle climate change and so does Liechtenstein. We recognise the urgent need 
to protect biodiversity and improve adaptation measures and to take early ac-
tion to reduce vulnerability to the massive effects of climate change. Liechten-
stein therefore supports the Glasgow Leader’s declaration on Forests and Land 
Use. 
 
Some of us have argued that reducing greenhouse gas emissions while achiev-
ing economic and social well-being is incompatible. Liechtenstein can serve as 
"an example to prove the opposite. Since 1990, our population has grown by "
"one third and our GDP has more than quadrupled. Nevertheless, Liechtenstein "
will achieve the Kyoto-target 2020 and reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 
levels well below those of 1990. Greenhouse gas emissions per capita are 
"amongst the lowest in Europe, despite the fact that Liechtenstein is one of the "
most industrialised countries in the world. It is therefore possible to decouple 
"economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. To make this happen, con-"
sistent investment in innovative technologies to boost renewable energies and 
"to increase energy efficiency is essential. For instance, Liechtenstein has been "
solar world champion since 2015 with the highest installed photovoltaic capac-
ity per capita. 
 
3
                                                           
"However, we need to go beyond these achievements. We are committed to "
"achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In October 2020, the Liechtenstein Gov-"
"ernment has adopted the climate vision 2050, the energy strategy 2030 and "
the energy vision 2050. The goal of net-zero-emissions has also been intro-
duced into our national legislation. I am personally committed to promote the 
implementation of these goals. 
 
In the spirit of the 2030 Agenda – which embeds climate change in SDG 13 – we 
are fully aware that we should not limit our action to reduce emissions domes-
"tically. Many of the goods we import and consume are produced abroad. Also, "
our financial sector invests globally and has an influence on emissions in other 
countries. Sustainable finance and production are therefore crucial. Many pri-
vate companies in Liechtenstein from the industrial and financial sector have 
published ambitious commitments with regard to sustainability. Such private 
commitments towards sustainable transformation of the global economy are 
crucial and I encourage more private actors to follow this path. 
 
The Liechtenstein Government supports developing countries in their effort to 
improve mitigation actions and adaptation to climate change and dedicate 
around ten percent of our annual budget for International Humanitarian Coop-
eration and Development to climate finance. Supporting the Green Climate 
"Fund is a key element of our financial engagement. Per capita, we contribute "
with USD 70 to climate finance annually. And the Government is committed to 
"further increase climate finance from next year, with a focus on the humanitar-"
ian sector. I personally welcome the Climate and Energy charter of the ICRC. 
Liechtenstein will support the efforts of the humanitarian sector to become 
more climate and environment friendly.

"In the course of our more than three hundred years of sovereignty, Liechten-"
stein has developed from an agrarian into a highly industrialised economy. Only 
farsighted thinking and clear dedication to multilateral cooperation allowed us 
"to overcome and continuously prosper amidst many challenges. In that sense, I "
"urge all States, according to our common but differentiated responsibility, to "
collectively and individually increase our ambitions and follow through with im-
plementation. 
 
Thank you!

"Address of the President of the Republic of Lithuania, Gitanas Nausėda, "
at the UN Climate Change Conference 
"Mister President, "
"Excellencies, "
"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
Lithuania is committed to be a part of the global solution.  
"As nature is declining at an unprecedented rate, it is time for us to come "
"together as humankind. Big and small, North and South, rich and poor – we "
must all change our ways and stop the climate crisis that leads to biodiversity 
loss and threats to public health. 
Lithuania knows that crises come with opportunities. We know the power of 
"change. Ten years ago, we transformed our heating sector by switching from "
natural  gas to sustainable indigenous biomass. We  kept  more  money  in 
"people’s  pockets and  we also reduced  pollution emissions,  while  staying "
competitive.  
Today  Lithuania strongly  supports  international  and EU climate  change 
goals. We have already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 58 percent. Our 
"plan, endorsed by the parliament, is to go further: to decrease greenhouse gas "
emissions by 70 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to cover at 
least  50  percent  of  our  electricity  needs from renewables.  The  whole 
Lithuanian economy will be climate neutral by 2050. 
"As fossil fuel prices are reaching new highs, I see new opportunities. The "
Paris Agreement together with the digitization drive form a clear roadmap. 
"To achieve ambitious goals, new partnerships must be forged both locally "
and internationally.  
"That is why  I  called  on  Lithuanian municipalities,  businesses, industries, "
"NGO’s, and every Lithuanian to join the Green Lithuania Declaration. My "
country also encourages closer regional cooperation and joint Baltic States’ 
"actions to tackle climate change and the deterioration of the Baltic Sea, and "
to better preserve our nature. 


                                                          
 
                                                          
 

"As  a global  community, we  should rethink  the  ways  we  produce  and "
"consume. For the industry production to leave no CO2 footprint, it needs to "
move closer  to  consumer  markets. We  should  also  pay  more  attention  to 
compliance with  the  highest  environmental  and  nuclear  standards.  Our 
technological shift should be sustainable and environmentally friendly. 
"Fellow Leaders, we all hold keys to a better future. Let us use them for global "
welfare! 


                                                          
 
PRESIDENT OF MONTENEGRO MILO ĐUKANOVIĆ 
 
"World Leaders Summit, UNFCCC Conference COP26  "
"1 November 2021, Glasgow, United Kingdom "
 
 
"Your Excellences, "
 
It is a great honour to address you all on behalf of Montenegro.  
 
"This  year’s  COP26, organized  in  the  circumstances  of  the  pandemic, is  a  great "
achievement. I would therefore first like to thank the host – the Government of the 
"United Kingdom. This is yet another confirmation of the fact that, if we respect the "
"rules and strict restrictions, if we are willing to sacrifice the comfort we are used to, "
"and if we do it together with solidarity, we can achieve our goal.  "
 
I believe it is the best path to ensure the most effective response to climate change. 
"Through common responsibility, solidarity and cooperation – through multilateralism.  "
 
International public has high expectations.   
 
 
Everything that we have done so far has not been sufficient to prevent increase of 
emissions. Climate change and loss of biodiversity are existential threats. Devastating 
effects of the pandemic make the situation additionally complex.  
 
"Warming of our planet is faster than we hoped, and it is only human hand that can "
make the move to slow that process down.  
 
National responsibility and responsibility to global community lead us to do what we 
have to do and what we have already committed to achieve – save the Planet and 
"ensure more secure, greener and more sustainable future.  "
 
We confirmed our last year’s climate ambition: Montenegro submitted its updated 
nationally determined contribution to emission reduction of 35% by 2030. 
 
"Still, we are here today to show our willingness to go beyond what we know we can: "
to  confirm that  we  are ready  and  that  we  have faith to go  faster  and to be more 
demanding for common benefit.  
 
Montenegro undertook to share the climate ambition and to be climate neutral 
together with the EU by 2050. Integration into EU is the strategic course of our 
"country, and Montenegro will do everything to succeed.  "
 
   •  By the end of 2021 we will update emissions inventory in line with the 
      new methodology of the Inter-governmental Panel. 
   •  By the end of 2023 we will finalize the first draft of the National Energy 
      and Climate Plan. 
  • Early in 2024 we will complete the National Adaptation Plan. 
  • We will intensify our work on the adoption of the Low-Carbon 
    Development Strategy and join the group of states that actively plan and 
    define policies and measures for reduction and mitigation of climate 
    change. 
"  • With the next update of the nationally determined contribution, we will "
    go a step further. We believe that it will include additional reduction of 
"    5%, which will be the total of 40%.  "
 
We want Montenegro to be a regional role model for successful green 
transition.  
 
"We believe that it is possible to achieve climate change and energy goals, "
development goals and European integration goals at the same time.  
 
I am here to express our clear determination and commitment.  
 
The political will that we are confirming here today has to be translated into a 
prompt climate action. This is the last opportunity to put things under control 
and we cannot afford to waste it.  
 

"Speech by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, at the 26th UN Climate "

LEESVERSIE 
 
"Ladies and gentlemen, "
 
"This summer, in the south of the Netherlands, I stood on the bank of the "
"Maas River, which was threatened by flooding caused by extreme "
rainfall.  
It was a terrifying sight.  
"There, the dikes held.  "
But elsewhere in the province and across the border in Belgium and 
"Germany, raging torrents caused devastation.  "
This is only one sad example that illustrates today’s reality.  
More and more people worldwide are being impacted by climate change. 
"It’s serious, and it calls for serious action. "
 
"First, we need further binding, global commitments and concrete "
measures to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees.  
"For example, reducing harmful emissions to net zero. "
Delivering a sustainable energy transition that offers new opportunities.  
And investing in a circular economy.  
COP26 can and must make real progress on these points. 
 
 
 
 


1
 
 

But we have to face reality: climate change is already having lasting 
effects.  
"So climate resilience must be our motto, climate adaptation our common "
endeavour.  
The Kingdom of the Netherlands has been battling the elements for 
centuries.  
From North Sea floods to Caribbean storms. 
Adaptation is in our DNA. 
But due to climate change we’re facing an unprecedented challenge. 
We’re working hard to address it. 
Both at home and at international level. 
"For example, by hosting the Climate Adaptation Summit earlier this year.  "
And as co-host of the UN 2023 Water Decade Conference. 
 
"Adaptation is the right thing to do, but it’s also the smart thing to do.  "
Studies show that investing in adaptation and resilience works. 
"Because climate-proofing cities, farming and infrastructure protects "
livelihoods and ensures economic continuity.  
And innovative nature-based solutions and sustainable business models 
create new jobs and economic opportunities.  
Climate adaptation pays off – in so many ways.   
 
"But for the most vulnerable communities, adaptation funds are often in "
short supply. 
That’s why we need to support each other.  
More than half our Kingdom’s public climate financing goes to 
adaptation.  
And it’s made up almost entirely of grant funding.  
We hope that more countries will follow suit.  

2
 
 

 
Because climate mitigation and adaptation are two sides of the same 
coin.  
You can’t have one without the other.  
And with that principle as our guide we have to take action.  
"Timely, firm and concerted action.  "
 
"Ladies and gentlemen, you can count on the Kingdom of the "
Netherlands.  
And we are counting on you. 
 
Thank you.

"Your Excellencies, "
 
"With  the  pandemic  still  dominating  the  world’s  agenda,  we  should  not "
underestimate one of the greatest systemic risks ever posed to the humanity.  
 
Scientists  say  there  might  be  only  one  decade  left  for  the  world  to 
"fundamentally redesign its development paradigms, to change our life habits "
and  reconstruct  our  economies  on  sustainable  basis.  If  we  ignore  this 
"worrying trends, catastrophic consequences will follow for the environment, "
"health,  food  and  water  security,  in  fact,  for  the  overall  human  safety  and "
development. 
  
"So, what we promised in Paris, we must deliver here in Glasgow. "
  
"As  EU  candidate  country  ready  to  start  negotiations,  North  Macedonia  has "
already been transposing European climate acquis in its national legislation. 
"By supporting the European Green Deal, we are committed to do our share in "
turning Europe into the first carbon neutral continent by 2050.  
 
"Despite the fact that we are a small European country, we have great climate "
"ambitions.  To  this  end,  we  adopted  the  enhanced  National  Determined "
Contributions. Our target for 2030 is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
"51%, compared to 1990 levels, or, 82% in net emissions compared to the same "
base  year.  We  designed  63  mitigation  policies  and  measures  which  are 
gender-responsive and are linked to 15 Sustainable Development Goals.  
 
By  implementing  our  Long-term  strategy  on  climate  action  we  aim  to 
"transform  North  Macedonia  into  a  low  carbon  economy,  enhancing "
competitiveness  and  promoting  social  cohesion.  This  “whole  of  society” 
"approach will help us fight unemployment by creating green jobs, decrease "
pollution with renewables and develop sustainable habits through education.  
 
We have made these commitments against the backdrop of several structural 
"challenges to our domestic economic growth, worsened by the devastating "
"effects of Covid-19, because we do believe that the only sustainable recovery "
from the pandemic is green recovery. If the country with the GDP per capita 
of  below  6.000  US  dollars  is  fully  dedicated  to  achieving  these  ambitious 
"pledges, then each state in the world can do it.    "
 
 


"We  have  already  designed  transparent,  coordinated  and  inclusive  climate "
"action in partnership with science, businesses, civil society and youth. In the "
"same time, we are fully aware that international financing will be dependent "
"on  the  effective,  functional  and  just  governance  at  both  national  and "
international level.  
 
"Dear friends, "
 
"50 years ago, W.H. Auden penned the ”Hymn to the United Nations”. In it he "
"says that “peace means to change at the right time, as the World-Clock Goes "
Tick-  and  Tock.”  For  too  long  humanity’s  unsustainable  models  of 
production and consumption have been out of sync with the rhythm of nature. 
"At this last hour, it is high time to wind back the clock of the climate system, "
"so that future generations can not only survive, but, live in a secure, decent "
"and prosperous world, as well.  "
 
Thank you. 
 
               
 

     Intervenção do Sr. Ministro do Ambiente e da Ação 
                   Climática na COP 26  

          Speech of the Minister of Environment  
              and climate Action of Portugal 
                              

"                Glasgow, 9th November 2021 "

     

"President of COP26, Alok Sharma, "

Dear Minister and colleagues 

"Ladies and Gentlemen, "

Let me start by thanking the Government of the United Kingdom 
for the organization of the COP26 and for all the work done in the 
difficult circumstances we have all been facing since our last COP 
in Madrid. 

There  is  only  one  acceptable  outcome  for  COP26:  one  that 
commits  all  Parties  to  a higher  level  of  climate  action and 
ambition; onethat delivers the complete rulebook for the full 
implementation of the Paris Agreement.  

Science  needs  to  be  heard  and  integrated  into  planning  and 
"decision-making processes at national, regional and local level.  "

1
 
               
 
"And for that, National Determined Contributions (NDC) and Long "
Term Strategies (LTS) should reflect the urgency of delivering the 
"1,5ºC  goal  including  through  ambitious  short  term  action  and "
through net-zero commitments by mid-century. 

Portugal was the first country in the world to commit to climate 
neutrality by 2050. 

The European Union did so when it made the goal to be climate 
"neutral by  2050  and achieve negative  emissions  thereafter, "
"through  its  Climate  Law,  which  approved  in  the  Portuguese "
Presidency of the Council of the European Union. 

Leadership lies with those who have phased-out coal; who put a 
price  on  carbon;  who declined investments in fossil fuels;  who 
"invested in renewable energy; and in creating climate resilient, "
"biodiverse territories, with the capacity to enhance carbon sinks, "
through natural-based solutions.  

"From  this  month  onwards, Portugal  will end  coal power "
generation. 

"In 2020, we reduce our emissions by 32%, in relation to 2005, "
and   more  than 60%  of  our power generation  was based  on 
"renewables. We will continue to invest in renewables, especially "
in solar energy. These investments are now being complemented 
with projects based on green hydrogen. 

2
 
               
 
 

In  Paris we  were  looking  at  commitments  that  would  put  us 
collectively at 3.1°C. Recent reports were pointing still to 2.7°C.  

This is not enough. And not fast enough. The most recent IPCC 
report clearly shows that. 

"We all must be aware that the longer we delay climate action, the "
more  intense  its  effects  will  be  and  the  greater  the  costs  of 
inaction.  

"Ladies and Gentlemen, "

Finalising  the Katowice  rulebook is  key  to  ensure  the  Paris 
Agreement's full operative and move forward.  

I hope that consensus can be reached on common time frames 
of 5-years for the NDCs of all Parties since it´s the most effective 
way to synchronize the national commitments of the Parties with 
the Paris cycle of Ambition.  

"On Article 6, we need a result that allows actions, including "
voluntary  carbon  market  actions  that  ensure  integrity  and 
environmental  ambition  and  are  consistent  with  the  necessary 
increase in global ambition.  


3
 
               
 
It  is crucial to complete  the  Framework  for  Enhanced 
"Transparency, ensuring that all Parties can report on progress "
"in a comparable, quantified and transparent manner.  "

Climate finance is key and our priority should be to focus on 
delivering  the  current  goal.  We  need  to  continue  work  on 
"broadening the donor base, mobilising the private sector, and to "
"achieve a better balance between mitigation and adaptation, in "
line with the priorities of the receiving countries.  

"Portugal is committed to continue financing climate action, in "
"particular through  the Portuguese Environmental  Fund, in "
"partner  countries, such  as Portuguese  Speaking  African "
Countries. 

As  a  sign  of  our  commitment we  pledge  to  double  climate 
"finance, allocating a total of 35 million euros by 2030. "

"COP 26 must deliver a strong message on carbon pricing, on "
"phasing  out  of  fossil  fuel  subsidies,  and  the  relevance  of "
aligning public and private financial flows with the objectives of 
"the Paris Agreement, as part of a green recovery. "

"Dear Colleagues, "

We  know  we  will  not  be  able  to  avoid  all  impacts  of climate 
"change, some of which we are already facing.  "

4
 
               
 
"We are working on a National Roadmap for Adaptation, which "
aims  to  update   Portugal’s climate  change  vulnerability 
assessment and define further adaptation action in Portugal for 
the 21st century. 

And    we  have   submitted   our   national   Adaptation 
Communication outlining our current work on adaptation.  

"Ladies and Gentlemen, "

Six years have passed since the approval of the Paris Agreement 
and the evidence of climate change is now clearer than ever.  

"Leadership  must  be  shown  inside  these  rooms,  led  by  the "
"democracies  of  the  world,  with  the  support  of the  multilateral "
process. That is the only way to ensure climate justice. 

"In  order  not  to  fail  on  that  leadership  we,  collectively,  need  to "
deliver on the goals that science shows us to be required to tackle 
climate change.  

"Not to fail, we should listen tothe younger generations and make "
sure we grant them a healthy planet and a hopeful future.  

"We are here, we are listening, and we know we must deliver.  "

And we will not give up this responsibility.

"    Remarks by President of the Republic of Korea, Jae-in Moon "

"              World Leaders Summit at COP26, 1 November 2021 "
 
(Check against delivery) 
 
"Your Excellency Prime Minister Boris Johnson,  "
Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa of the UN Framework Convention on Climate 
"Change (UNFCC),   "
"Excellencies,  "
 
"Oak  tree  forests  in  Glasgow  lead  us  into  the  world  of  mythology  where  humans, "
animals and plants live in harmony.   
Nature has long been waiting for us.  
"Now, it is our turn to act and return love to nature. "
COP 26 will mark a starting point.    
"Which, I hope, will set us on a course to stop further global warming and respond to "
nature that has been so patient with us.   
 
I stand here today to make three promises and one proposal.  
"First,  the  Republic  of  Korea  is enhancing  its  2030  NDC  targets  to  cut  greenhouse "
gas emissions by at least 40 percent from 2018 levels.  
This  is  a  bold  target  that  has  been  raised  some  14%  from  the  existing one - a 
Herculean task indeed that demands steep emission cuts over a short time horizon.  
 
Never an easy undertaking – yet the Korean people decided: It is time to act NOW!  
Korea cemented its 2050 net zero commitment into law and announced its carbon 
neutrality scenarios.   
We are also pledging to lower methane emissions by 30% by 2030.  
"Methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, holds the key to tackling "
the climate crisis.  
Korea  will  join  the  Global  Methane  Pledge  to  actively  participate  in  methane 
reduction efforts.  
 
"Second, as  the  only  country  that  has  successfully  rehabilitated  its  forest  since  the "
"second World War, Korea will drive cooperation in forest restoration.   "
Trees are carbon sinks that live and breathe.   
Growing trees and bringing forests back to life offers a vital solution to the climate 
crisis.  
It also shows us the way to avert desertification and promote peace in border areas.  
Korea  welcomes  the  Glasgow Leaders’  Declaration  on  Forests  and  Land  Use  and 
promises to fully cooperate in rejuvenating forests in developing countries.   
"Moreover,  through inter-Korean forestry  cooperation,  we  will  strive  to  mitigate "
greenhouse gas emissions across the entire Korean Peninsula.  
"In  May  next  year, Korea  will  host  the  World  Forestry Congress and  I  ask  for  the "
global community’s support and cooperation for its success.  
 
"Third, Korea pledges to join the global endeavors to reduce the use of coal.  "
"Since  the  launch  of  my  government,  Korea has  decommissioned  eight  coal-fired "
power  plants  earlier  than  scheduled  with  two  more  units  planned  for  closure  by 
yearend.   
"By 2050, coal-fired power generation will be phased out completely.  "
"We already stopped issuing permits for new domestic coal power plants, and in April, "
suspended public financing for new overseas coal-fired power generation as well.  
Korea will fully cooperate with developing countries in their transition to a low-carbon 
economy including development of renewable energies.  
Korea will also reduce carbon footprint of Korean businesses operating abroad.  
"Through the Green Climate Fund and the Global Green Growth Institute,  "
"we  will  continue  providing  climate  finance,  and  utilizing  the  Climate  Technology "
"Center  and  Network,  step  up  our  cooperation  with  developing  countries  in  green "
technology.   
 
"Excellencies,  "
 
One proposal I am making is to hold the Youth4Climate on a regular basis.  
Carbon neutrality is a challenging task that governments and businesses can hardly 
accomplish on their own. 
It is a goal that is achievable only when every citizen joins in.   
If our future generations who are directly affected by the climate crisis work together 
"with  older generations  to  find  solutions,  we  will  be  able  to  advance  faster  towards "
building a sustainable world.   
"For regular convening of the Youth4Climate, I ask the leaders for their keen interest "
and support.  
 
"For Mother  Nature,  let  people  hold  hands  with  one  another,  countries  join  hands "
together.   
We should never regret that we did not act soon enough for our planet.  
Thank you.  

 
                   National Statement at COP26 
                          Romania 
             Delivered by President Klaus Werner Iohannis 
 
"     Mr President of COP26,  "
"     Excellencies,  "
"     Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
      
     There is no denial that climate change is a tremendous challenge and that 
we need to show ambition in addressing it!   
"     From  1989  to  2019,  Romania’s  greenhouse  gas  emissions  decreased  by "
64%. We have one of the lowest rates of emissions/capita in the European Union. 

"Between 1990 and 2019, Romania has also reduced its CO2 emission intensity per "
"unit of GDP by 77%, a percentage more than double the global average.  "
     But  we  are  committed  to  do  more!  Further  reducing  emissions  will  be 
"challenging, especially as we move closer to net zero. I want us to work together "
"to develop, manufacture and deploy new green technologies.  "
"     Innovation is key. Among other Glasgow initiatives, Romania joins the US-"
driven Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate. We also need to make sure 
"that nobody is left behind in the process of green transition, jobs are created and "
social inequalities reduced.   
     Romania fully supports the EU’s leading efforts on climate change and is 
committed to contribute to the EU overall 55% emission reduction by 2030. We 
have already achieved this reduction rate nationally and we are committed to keep 
cutting.  
"     Ladies and Gentlemen,  "


1
 
     There is no silver bullet against climate change. A set of interconnected 
measures can help us deliver. We will harness the very force of nature. Romania 
"has a solid share of renewable energy in its energy mix, with 40% of our electricity "
coming from renewable sources. We are committed to expand this share.  
     We  will  fight  climate  change  with  nature-based  solutions  using  57.000 
hectares  of  new  forests  in  our  Recovery  Plan  to  capture  carbon  and  combat 
desertification.  
     We also need to channel the force of people in addressing climate change. 
Education  is  key  to  environmentally  friendly  behaviour.  We  must  advance 
"education and research on climate change. Starting in 2023, Romania will host an "
"innovative World Meteorological Organization Centre, that will help agricultural "
systems in Europe better respond to climate change.  
     The impact of climate change has no national borders. Let’s join our forces 
"in protecting the environment, making sure we leave future generations a greener "
and safer planet! 
     There is no time to lose! The time for action is now! 
     Thank you!

"Your Excellences, Ladies and Gentlemen, "
     
Addressing global warming and prevention of climate change 
depends on the ability of all nations to set aside differences and 
join together in resolving these challenges.  
 
Russia is mostly a northern country. Yet we are facing negative 
"impacts of global warming including increase of desert areas, "
"soil erosion, forest fires, floods and melting of permafrost. We "
take these matters seriously and responsibly.  
 
As  you might  be well  aware  the  President  of  the  Russian 
Federation Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia will reach 
carbon  neutrality  by  2060.  This  promise  is  based  on a 
comprehensive  approach  covering  not  only  the  problems  of 
controlling  and  decreasing  emission  but  also  managing  and 
improving greenhouse gas absorbing capabilities of our natural 
"ecosystems  including  forests,  tundra,  farmland,  marshes  and "
seas. 
 
Taking a promise of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 does 
not  mean  that  Russia  is  refraining  from  achieving  this  goal 
                        

earlier. The success depends on availability of new technologies 
and funds to finance this transition.  
 
Through  history  human  ingenuity  has  always  led  to  finding 
solutions to the most complex issues. We are confident that this 
time humanity will also develop solutions that will bring a better 
future. Climate change requires all countries to work together 
and share knowledge and tools.  
 
"Therefore,  there should  be  no discrimination  or restrictions "
preventing countries from accessing and using technologies and 
financing  tools that  will  facilitate  development  of  new 
"sustainable infrastructure, capture and storage, decarbonization, "
"improvement  of  energy  efficiency, and  support  transition  to "
clean energy. And if someone will be hampering this all of us 
would know who should be blamed for failing to reach climate 
goals.      
 
International efforts are also critical for enhancing cooperation 
"in areas of ecosystem management, developing and improving "
monitoring and reporting emission and absorption practices as 
well  as measuring  progress  in  meeting  climate  goals.  It  is 


  

3
                        

critical to develop common fair and transparent rules for carbon 
pricing measurement and ensure their multilateral recognition 
and comparability between countries.    
 
In October 2021 the Russian Government has adopted a new 
2050 Strategy of Social and Economic Development with Low 
Greenhouse Gas Emission. This strategy outlines measures that 
by 2050 compared to 1990 will bring our country to an 80% net 
reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions while maximizing 
absorbing capacity of our forests and other ecosystems. It also 
outlines low  greenhouse  gas emission  development  measures 
until 2050. 
 
"To  achieve  these  ambitious  objectives,  we  are  focusing  on "
"improving  our  forest  management  practices, enhancing "
"wildland fire prevention and response capabilities, preserving "
"and  increasing  wilderness  areas, introducing new farming "
practices as well as engaging in transformation towards cleaner 
energy. Our energy companies are implementing low emission 
"technologies to ensure production, delivery and distribution of "
cleaner fuel to consumers. Our regions started pilot projects that 


  

4
                        

will  help  finding  solutions  to  these  problems. We  welcome 
participation of international community in these projects.     
 
New  renewable  energy  sources  are  increasing  their  share  in 
energy balances of countries throughout the world. With 86% 
"of our energy generation coming from solar, wind, natural gas, "
nuclear and hydro power Russia’s energy balance is already an 
example  of  one of  the  lowest  carbon  emissions per  unit. We 
intend to maintain this leadership by introducing blue and green 
hydrogen  and  promoting  the  use  this new fuel  through  the 
economy. 
 
At the same time our Government Strategy is pursuing the goal 
of finding and maintaining a balance between policies aimed at 
addressing  climate  challenges  and  reaching  sustainable 
development  goals to continue economic  growth  and 
improvement of living standard of our people.  
 
Building a safer  environment  implies  significant investments 
"and changes  that  will  affect  economies,  create  new  markets, "
redirect resources and alter supply chains as well as lives of the 
people. It is our deep belief that addressing global warming and 


  

5
                        

climate change should not lead to further increase of poverty. 
Not just in the developing but in the developed world as well.  
 
Transition to new economy should be based on an equilibrium 
where investment  returns  and  long-term  asset  value  increase 
will be balanced by reliable energy supply that meets growing 
energy demand as well as the goals of reduction and absorption 
of greenhouse gas emissions. The solution of this equilibrium 
will determine the living standard of our descendants. This is a 
new economic balance that all of us will need to find together. 
   
"And while this will be happening, at the time of these enormous "
"changes,  Russia  will  remain  a  reliable  supplier  of  energy  to "
international markets and consumers. 
 
Hope  I did not take too much of your time. Thank  you very 
much.

    SIMONCINI AT THE 26TH SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE 
  PARTIES TO THE UNITED NATIONS FRAMEWORK CONVENTION ON 
                             CLIMATE CHANGE 
                                 (Glasgow) 
                                        
"Mr. President,  "

"Excellencies, Colleagues, "

"Ladies and Gentlemen, "

we would like to express our thanks to the British and Italian authorities for 
the excellent organisation of this important event.  

The recent IPCC report confirms that negative predictions are now a certainty. 
"To quote UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the report is ‘a code red’ for "
humanity. It will force us to take increasingly difficult choices. Good intentions 
cannot remain pious hopes: if political commitments taken during these days 
"remained a dead letter, it would be an intolerable defeat. "

We recognize that the impacts of climate change at 1.5°C are much lower than 
at 2°C and that immediate action must be taken to keep 1.5°C within reach. 
"We acknowledge the close nexus between climate and energy, as well as we "
understand the importance of a just and inclusive clean energy transition. 

San  Marino  is  a  small  State but  being  small  does  not  prevent  us  to  be 
"ambitious. We want to be an open-air laboratory, where innovations by willing "
"and  fair-minded   people   are  discussed,  tested  and   assessed   on  their "
effectiveness. It  is  indeed  possible  and  necessary  to  start  small  in  order  to 
"implement big changes, to move one step at a time, but decisively.  "

                        REGGENZA DELLA REPUBBLICA 


"Therefore, we would like to call on small nations to join efforts to implement "
common initiatives that would otherwise be beyond their reach. We cannot but 
call on international organisations to devise new systems that will enable small 
"states to make a stronger multilateral contribution. Together we are stronger, "
as the history of the United Nations teaches us. San Marino wants to be active 
"with other Nations, now more than ever. "

"In July 2021, San Marino presented its first Voluntary National Review on the "
implementation of the 17 goals of the 2030 Agenda. We are currently drawing 
our 'Action plan for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals’ 
and the first draft will be ready by the end of the year. Action to combat climate 
"change, under Goal 13, features prominently on the set of national initiatives. "

"Virtuous policies we intend to implement are numerous, from the development "
of renewable sources to the promotion of electric and hybrid mobility. Measures 
"to  increase  the  energy  efficiency  of  buildings,  to  contain  emissions  from "
companies and to strengthen a national centralised data collection system are 
equally crucial.  

San Marino has made and is making its best efforts to respect the commitments 
deriving from all the very important Agreements that have brought us this far. 
"We know well, however, that it is not enough. If we do not act together, the "
consequences of our inaction will go far beyond state borders and will harshly 
"affect  next  generations, who  are  uniting  in  movements  such  as Fridays  for "
Future. Young people are clamouring for just one thing: the courage to change. 
"We  owe  them   a  credible answer,  because  it  is  their  future  and  we  cannot "
prevent them to live in a better planet.    

Thank you for your attention.

NATIONAL STATEMENT OF SINGAPORE DELIVERED BY GRACE 
"FU,  MINISTER  FOR  SUSTAINABILITY  AND  THE  ENVIRONMENT, "
"AT  THE  UNFCCC  COP-26  HIGH  LEVEL  SEGMENT, 9 NOVEMBER "
"2021, GLASGOW, THE UNITED KINGDOM "
 
"Mr President,  "
 
1.  Congratulations on your election as President of this Conference. I thank 
"the UK Government, the City of Glasgow, and the UNFCCC Secretariat, for their "
efforts in  organising COP-26 in  a  safe and  efficient  manner. I also thank the 
Chilean and UK COP Presidencies for their able leadership in the lead-up to this 
"conference, in guiding  Parties  to advance  discussions in  a  transparent  and "
facilitative manner. 

COP-26: A Push for Global Climate Action  
 
"2.  Even as we grapple with COVID-19, we need to take urgent collective "
"action to address the global climate crisis. After a year’s postponement, COP-26 "
must make up for lost time. It has been almost six years since the Paris Agreement 
was  adopted.  This  conference  needs to demonstrate that  the  multilateral 
framework of cooperation delivers on climate action. 

"       a. First, COP-26  must work collectively  towards the  long-term "
         temperature goal under the Paris Agreement.  
               
           i. All  Parties must come  forward  with  ambitious Nationally 
              Determined  Contributions  (NDCs) and Long-Term  Low-
"              Emissions  Development  Strategy (LEDS), and deliver "
              concrete implementation plans to achieve them. 
               
           ii. While it is clear from the NDC synthesis report that we are 
"              not there yet, COP-26 must provide a clear roadmap on how "
"              we  will  close this gap  post-Glasgow, to  keep  1.5  degrees "
              within reach. 
          
"       b. Second, we must complete outstanding negotiations under the Paris "
"         Agreement Work Programme, or the “Paris Rulebook”. "
               
"           i. As  co-facilitator for  ministerial  consultations  on  Article  6, "
"              alongside Norway, Singapore will work with all Parties in this "
              final  stretch to identify  pragmatic  solutions  to  achieve a 
              credible and balanced package under this track that meets the 


 
           

"       needs  of  all  Parties,  while  safeguarding  environmental "
       integrity. 
 
    ii. We shall also finalise the outstanding technical work under 
       the  Enhanced  Transparency  Framework and come  to  a 
       decision on common reporting timeframes for NDCs. 
               
  The  completion  of  the  Paris  Rulebook will  see  us shifting from 
  negotiations to concrete implementation and collaboration. It is time 
  for us to put an end to this chapter that has gone on for 6 years. 
   
"c. Third, COP-26 must deliver a strong support package for developing "
  countries.  This  will enable developing countries  to  implement 
"  effective adaptation strategies and achieve their climate pledges, so "
  that we can collectively fulfil the Paris Agreement’s goals. 
     
    i. Developed  countries should  fulfil their  commitment to 
       mobilise US$100 billion per year in climate finance to support 
       the climate actions of developing countries. 
        
    ii. Climate finance would need to take into account the needs of 
       developing countries. We encourage developed countries to 
       consider the recommendations of the Standing Committee on 
       Finance’s  (SCF) first  report  on  the  needs  of  developing 
       countries when delivering on climate finance for developing 
       countries. 
        
"   iii. Looking ahead, we must address the long-standing imbalance "
       between  mitigation  and  adaptation  financing. This  is 
       particularly important for many vulnerable low-lying Small 
       Island Developing States (SIDS) for which rising sea levels 
       already threaten lives and livelihoods. 
               
    iv. We also look forward to constructive deliberations over the 
       new collective quantified goal (NCG) on climate finance. We 
       hope that the lessons gained from the US$100 billion goal can 
       be applied to the NCG to achieve a post-2025 climate finance 
       goal  that  is mutually  agreed and in  line  with  the  Paris 
       Agreement. 
        


           
 

"       d. Fourth, we  must strengthen  partnerships. Nations cannot  do this "
"         alone. To achieve an effective transition to a net zero future, we need "
         “all hands on deck”. 

           i. We welcome the progress at the Marrakech Partnership for 
              Global  Climate Action  in galvanising partnerships between 
"              governments, businesses, cities and civil society.  "
               
           ii. We  must  continue  to  build  on  these  and other  initiatives 
              launched by  the  UK and  other  coalition  partners at  this 
              conference. We hope to see these multi-stakeholder alliances 
"              spur a global  clean  energy  transition, as  we  collectively "
              develop  and  deploy cutting-edge  technologies such  as low 
              carbon hydrogen and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage 
              (CCUS). 
     
 
Singapore committed to playing our part 
 
"3.  As  a  responsible  member  of  the  international  community,  Singapore  is "
committed to playing our part in the global fight against climate change.  

    a. We take our Paris commitments seriously and are taking bold climate 
       actions.  
        
         i. Singapore was one of the first 20 Parties to submit our enhanced 
           NDC and LEDS in March last year. 
            
"         ii. In  February  this  year, we launched  the  Singapore  Green  Plan "
"           2030,  which complements  our  NDC  and  LEDS and sets out "
           concrete near-term plans to achieve our net zero aspiration. 
        
    b. As a small city-state with limited land and limited access to renewable 
"       energy, we face stark trade-offs. With a population density of more than "
"       twice that of Glasgow and no hinterland for green power, we do not "
       have ready options to mitigate our emissions. But we do not shy away 
       from taking bold actions where we can.  
         
"         i. We are continually pushing the bounds of solar energy, which is "
           our only viable source of renewable energy currently.  We aim to 
           quadruple  our solar deployment by 2025 from  2020  levels.  In 


 
 

"           July, we opened one of the world’s largest floating solar farms "
"           which will offset 33,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.  "
        
         ii. Besides pushing the bounds on domestic sources of renewable 
"           energy, we also plan to further reduce the carbon footprint of our "
           power sector by importing up to 4 gigawatts (GW) of low-carbon 
"           electricity  by  2035,  which  will  constitute  around  30%  of "
           Singapore’s electricity supply. 
            
        iii. We  are  aggressively  pushing  for  a  cleaner  and  more  efficient 
"           transport system. Since 2018, vehicle growth has been capped at "
           zero for  private  cars  and  motorcycles. We aim  to phase  out 
           internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040.  
            
"        iv. Under the OneMillionTrees movement, we aim to restore nature "
           back into our city through the planting of more than one million 
           trees across Singapore by 2030. This forms part of our greening 
           efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature as one of the 
           five pillars of our Singapore Green Plan 2030. 
     
         v. We  have  set  an  ambitious  “80-80-80  in  2030”  goal to (1) 
"           greening  80%  of  our  buildings  by  2030,  (2)  80%  of  new "
           developments  from  2030  onwards  to  be  Super  Low  Energy 
"           buildings,  and  (3)  80%  improvement  in  energy  efficiency  for "
           green buildings by 2030.  
     
"        vi. We have implemented a carbon tax, the first in Southeast Asia, "
           since 2019. And we are reviewing the level and trajectory of our 
           carbon tax to reflect the cost of carbon in investment decisions 
           effectively. We will announce the outcomes of our review early 
           next year.  
 
"4.  International collaboration, in areas such as carbon markets and regional "
"power grids, is crucial for Singapore to achieve our decarbonisation goals.  We "
are  working actively to tap low-carbon energy  beyond  our  shores. Regional 
power  grids  can  help  to accelerate  the investments  and development  of low-
carbon energy in the region and enhance electricity security and resilience for 
connected  parties. We hope our trials  and pilots  to  import electricity  from 
"Malaysia  and  Indonesia,  and  through  regional  arrangements  such  as  the  Lao "
"PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore  Power  Integration  Project, will serve  as  a "
"pathfinder  towards a broader  ASEAN  Power  Grid  vision, where low-carbon "
electricity is traded freely between ASEAN countries.   


 
 

5.  How fast we can move also depends on the development and maturity of 
emerging low-carbon  technologies  such  as carbon  capture and  low-carbon 
hydrogen. As and  when international  collaborations and new  enabling 
"technologies materialise, we will review and enhance our climate goals.  "

Importance of International Partnerships and Regional Cooperation 
 
"6.  Beyond Singapore’s requirement, international partnerships can strengthen "
our collective global climate action. We have joined several coalitions over the 
past week in Glasgow.  

    a. In line with the Presidency’s call for COP-26 to be one that “consigns 
"       coal to history”, we are pleased to be among the first countries in Asia "
"       to join the Powering Past Coal Alliance, led by the UK and Canada. We "
       have supported the Global Coal to Clean Power Transition Statement. 
"       Having pivoted from fuel oil to natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil "
"       fuel,  for  electricity  generation 2  decades  ago,  we  will  phase out "
       unabated coal power generation completely by 2050. We already do not 
       finance unabated coal power projects overseas. 
        
"    b. We are pleased to have joined the Global Methane Pledge, led by the "
"       US  and  the  EU,  in  support  of  its  collective  goal to reduce global "
       methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.  
     
"    c. We have also joined the Greening Government Initiative (GGI), led by "
"       the US and Canada, to facilitate cooperation and innovation in greening "
       government  operations.  Joining  the  GGI  complements our domestic 
"       efforts under GreenGov.SG, an initiative under the Singapore Green "
"       Plan 2030, to deliver on ambitious sustainability goals by the public "
       sector. 
        
    d. In line with our 30-by-30 goal to produce 30% of nutritional needs by 
"       2030, we have joined the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate "
"       (AIM4C),  led  by  the  US  and  the  United  Arab  Emirates, aimed  at "
       accelerating investment in and support for climate-smart agriculture and 
       food systems innovation.  
        
"7.  Apart from these initiatives, we are working closely with partners such as "
"Australia,  Chile, New  Zealand,  and  the  US to  collaborate  on  emerging  low-"
"carbon  technologies,  such  as  low-carbon  hydrogen  and  CCUS.  We  have "
commenced negotiations on a bilateral Green Economy Agreement (GEA) with 
"Australia, which will be a world-first agreement that combines trade, economic "


 
 

and environment objectives. We hope the GEA with Australia would be a useful 
pathfinder for similar GEAs with other countries.  

"8.  Regionally, we are playing our part to catalyse green finance to support "
Asia’s decarbonisation drive.  

    a. We have introduced initiatives to enhance financial sector resilience to 
"       environmental risks, develop green finance solutions and capabilities, "
       and  leverage technology to  mobilise  sustainable  capital.  We  are 
"       collaborating  with  other  central  banks, regulators,  and  international "
"       platforms such as the G20, Financial Stability Board and the Network "
"       for Greening the Financial System, to mainstream green finance, and "
       enhance  comparability  and  reliability  of  sustainability-related 
       disclosures. 
        
    b. We  are growing  our  ecosystem  of  services  in  carbon  markets  and 
"       carbon management, and partnering stakeholders, including those in the "
"       region, in the development of a high-quality carbon market. Climate "
"       Impact X1, a global carbon exchange and marketplace for high-quality "
"       and  risk-rated  carbon credits,  will  be  launched  in  Singapore.  The "
       exchange  will  leverage  technology  such  as  satellite  monitoring  to 
       ensure the transparency and integrity of carbon credits. 
 
"9.  Singapore  is supporting  efforts to build  and  enhance  climate  resilience, "
particularly in our region.  

    a. Through the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) and our Climate 
"       Action  Package,  we  have shared  our  experiences  with more  than "
"       132,000 government officials from over 180 countries, territories, and "
"       intergovernmental organisations in areas such as the green economy, "
"       sustainable development, urban planning, flood and water management, "
       disaster risk reduction. 
"       , "
"    b. We have committed S$5 million over five years, from 2018 to 2022, "
       through  the  ASEAN  Specialised Meteorological  Centre (ASMC) to 
       help build capabilities in weather forecasting and haze monitoring.  
        
"    c. Together with Japan and the World Bank, we jointly established the "
       Southeast  Asia  Disaster  Risk  Insurance  Facility  (SEADRIF)  in 

                   
"1 Climate Impact X (CIX) was established by DBS Bank (“DBS”), Singapore Exchange (“SGX”), Standard "
"Chartered Bank, and Temasek.  "

 
 

       Singapore to enable ASEAN countries to access disaster risk financing 
       solutions and increase financial resilience to climate and disaster risks. 
       The first financial solution developed by SEADRIF is a regional flood 
       risk insurance pool to provide post-disaster rapid response financing. 
 
Closing remarks 
"10. Mr President, the climate crisis is a wicked problem too big for any country "
to solve alone. Each country must pursue clear and effective climate actions that 
"represent its highest  possible  ambition,  in  the  light  of its size,  resource "
"endowment,  capabilities  and constraints. Our  national  circumstances  may  be "
"different, but the problem is a shared one.  "

"11. Beyond  individual  actions, we  need strong  and  effective  international "
cooperation. Global solidarity will help us overcome our respective challenges 
and achieve an outcome that is far greater than the sum of our parts.   

12. Singapore is committed to doing our part and will work with the UK and 
all Parties to secure strong outcomes for COP-26. 

Thank you.

 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) 
"      November 2, 2021 Glasgow "
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
"Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  "
COP has met several times since we agreed in Paris to reach net zero 
by mid-century. Yet the science is very clear: we are nowhere near 
this goal.  
Glasgow is make-or-break for the planet. We must double down on 
our efforts to cut emissions and mitigate the impact of the climate 
"crisis. If we fail, the only thing to discuss at future COPs will be the "
irreversible devastation of our planet and its habitats. This scenario 
"is just about avoidable – but so far, we seem to be failing to prevent "
it.  
"The young generation understands this. In my own country, "
"Slovakia, 42% of young people are very worried about the climate "
crisis. 73% think humanity has failed to look after our planet. Two 
thirds find politicians’ actions to address the climate crisis 
disappointing. A recent study carried out in a number of other 
countries has shown that 40% of young people consider not having 
children because of the climate crisis.  
It is clear: the next generation knows we are running out of time. 
And we as political leaders have run out of excuses. I am glad that as 
"the European Union, we are doing what is needed: reducing our "
"emissions by at least 55% by 2030, becoming the first climate-"
neutral continent by 2050 and helping developing countries do the 
same.  
Slovakia’s own emissions are down by 46% compared to 1990 
"levels, with methane reduced by more than half. Our electricity mix "
"is already 80% low on carbon, and, from 2023, we will not use coal "
to produce electricity. 43% of our post-pandemic recovery funds 
"will support sustainable green transition in transport, industry or "
"buildings, while not leaving the most vulnerable behind.  "
We know that this alone will not prevent the worst-case scenarios. 
It takes truly global action: not just by the EU and the rest of the 
"developed world, although we do shoulder a special responsibility. "
We must all do our fair share – including those states whose top 

2
representatives are not in Glasgow. This also applies to climate 
finance. In 2019 to 2023 Slovakia is doubling our voluntary 
contribution to the Green Climate Fund.  
"Excellencies,  "
The carbon footprint of the planes we arrived on cannot be the only 
output from this year’s COP. We must turn the Paris commitments 
into credible delivery and real CO2 reductions. We have different 
starting points and paths for development – but we do have one 
shared goal: preserving our planet. Let’s act accordingly. Thank you.
